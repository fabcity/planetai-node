# PLANETAI. Architecture
<!-- checked: v0.83.0 -->

The whole system on one page. What exists today is marked. What does not exist yet is drawn anyway, because the
contracts between layers cannot be added later.

## 1. Three layers, one loop

```

**Sense** gets data in. Our own hardware, other people's networks (Bali Air Dispatch, OpenAQ, Sensor.Community),
open data portals (Bali Satu Data, Open Data BCN), Earth foundation models (Open-Meteo, Aurora, Flood Hub),
and people (surveys, reports, WhatsApp campaigns). Everything arrives as `readings` with a `sensor_id`, a metric,
a time, and provenance.

**Observe** stores, aggregates, and publishes. Every instance exposes the same read API. The public surfaces
(planetai.fab.city observatory, index.fab.city atlas and city pages) are clients of that API. Bali Air Dispatch is
an observatory for one island, and a source we read. PLANETAI's observatory is the layer itself: any node,
aggregator or region publishes the same shape.

**Act** turns an observation into a human decision and, when the decision is physical, a fabrication ticket.
Rules → alerts → acknowledgement → action → outcome. Each step is timestamped. Agents *draft, never dispatch*;
every dispatch is a human approval written to a ledger.

**Index** is what the other two layers measure themselves against. DIDO and PITO cells from Observe; ρ from Act.
The Act layer is the only place ρ can be measured, so the Index is measured inside the loop and is not a separate
product.

## 2. One shape at every scale

Three ingestion classes, not one. A node at a house polls devices; a node at a lab also watches its city's portal;
a node anywhere on earth can sample a global model at its coordinates. Same core, same contracts, different `kind`:

| `sensors.kind` | what it is | cadence | scales it serves | shipped |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `sensor` | a device on your LAN or a nearby public one | minutes | Community, City | Smart Citizen, Meshtastic over MQTT; AirGradient and PurpleAir written, not polled |
| `portal` | an open-data or statistical API | days to months | City, Region, Bioregion | `ckan` (any CKAN portal) |
| `model` | a global model sampled at a point | hours | Planet, Bioregion | `openmeteo` |
| `survey` | people answering | campaign | Community, City | **not built** as a campaign: the four empty Social cells. The one `survey` row is `things:<node>`, the counts of the things a home keeps |
| `child` | a node below this one | hourly | the scale below | the aggregate push |

Slow sources land in the `observations` view (latest per source per metric); sensors land in `stats` (15m/1h/24h).
Full matrix and gaps: [`docs/COVERAGE.md`](docs/COVERAGE.md).


The same three layers exist at every scale of the Full Stack Metrics Framework. A node at a house and an
aggregator for a province run the same code with different sources, different rules, and a different parent.

| scale | instance | sense | observe | act | index cells |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Community** | node at an address, a lab, a banjar | own sensors + nearby public sensors | readings, hourly means, local API | shut windows / ventilate / swap sensor / print a part | `*\|Community` |
| **City** | aggregator for a district or municipality | children's hourly means + municipal open data (Bali Satu Data, Open Data BCN) | district means, maps, public API | advisories to a kelian or a council; fabrication queue for a lab | `*\|City` |
| **Region** | aggregator for a province / metro | children + regional inventories (Metroverse, KLEMS, procurement) | regional feeds | inter-city coordination, procurement templates | `*\|Region` |
| **Bioregion** | partner-hosted server (BSC, MIT CBA, UC Chile, ITDel) | children + hydrology / biodiversity / boundary data | decision-tier dashboards, knowledge graph | community-council veto; OSH/OKH response library | boundary conditions |
| **Planet** | federation over Earth models | Aurora, GraphCast, GenCast, AlphaEarth | global summary | none directly: it informs | boundary conditions |

Aggregation of Index cells stops at Region. Bioregion and Planet enter as boundary conditions, following the FCI
3.0 methodology: those two tiers publish context downward and do not summarise upward.

## 3. Contracts (the parts that must not change casually)

Every layer speaks three protocols. Compute, apps, and partner systems attach by speaking one of them.

**Every wire document says which document it is.** The ones below carry a top-level `schema`
key, and `tools/check_wire.py` in `make lint` holds their top-level shape against a fixture in
`tests/data/wire/`, so a key cannot be gained or lost without somebody editing that file on purpose.

| `schema` | the document | built by |
|---|---|---|
| `issues-v0` | `GET /issues`, the one document a client draws | `app/issues/engine.py::compute` |
| `export-v0` | `GET /export?day=`, the nightly open-data file, pinned to IPFS | `app/main.py::export` |
| `report-v0` | `GET /report/latest` | `app/main.py::report_latest` |
| `aggregates-v0` | the child's hourly push body | `app/main.py::push_aggregates` |
| `events-v0` | the child's ρ push body | `app/main.py::push_events` |
| `days-v0` | `GET /issues/days?days=`, the same hourly series over up to 90 days | `app/issues/engine.py::days` |

A receiver that sees a `schema` it does not know logs once and processes what it recognises. It never refuses,
because a parent one release behind has to keep accepting a child one release ahead. A document with
no `schema` is read as `-v0` and logged once as legacy. A version bumps only on a breaking change, and
the bump is a `docs/decisions/` entry. (`/health`'s `schema` is older and means something else: the
database schema version. Nothing else should use the name for two things.)

**Readings**: `(ts, sensor_id, metric, value)` + a `sensors` row `(source, name, lat, lon, indoor, local, meta)`.
Up: children push hourly means of their own sensors, each row saying whether it is indoors (`POST /aggregates`).
A child's peers and models stay with the child, because the parent counts everything it receives as its children's.
Down: a sensor or a phone the household trusts posts raw
(`POST /readings`, with the node's admin token: a posted reading counts as one of the house's own). The instance
decides what it keeps.

**Cells**: `fci-cells-v0`: `{city, cell: "Pillar|Scale", value, unit, source, observed_at, state: live|partial|mock}`.
Exactly the `FCI Observations` row. Every instance exposes `GET /cells`. The Index surface (or the aggregator above)
pulls them. Provenance `state` travels end to end and is never upgraded on the way.

**Actions**: `{alert_id, stage: acknowledged|decided|acted, ts, note}` via `POST /actions`. This is how ρ is
measured: detect (alert `ts`) → decide (`acknowledged`) → deploy (`acted`) → measure (`measured`, derived by the
node and never posted). `decided` is a record and enters no ρ. Five FCC-era stages collapse to these four at an
address; `fabricate` appears between decide and act when the action is a part.
An alert *event* (one story per issue per house, `ALERT_ENGINE=events`) is answered the same way with
`{event_id, stage: acted|acknowledged|dismissed}`: Done, Not now, Doesn't fit. It is a row in `actions` with an
`event_id` and no `alert_id`, and it enters no ρ.

**Read API** (the Observe contract): `GET /sensors /readings /stats /aggregates /alerts /cells /rho /health`, plus
`GET /report/latest` (the last report the node wrote) and `GET /report/bundle?hours=` (every number it was written
from, behind the read-only token).

**The report** is the node's one scheduled message: one every `REPORT_EVERY` hours from `REPORT_ANCHOR`, in local time,
written by the node from its own SQL so that a node with no model reachable still gets one. `app/report.py` holds
`bundle()` and `sheet()`; the `reports` row for the local hour is the scheduler's lock, so a restart inside the window
does not send it twice. A report due inside quiet hours is stored and not sent, and the next one folds those hours in.
Same at every scale. A mobile app, the planetai.fab.city observatory, a partner's dashboard, and the aggregator
above are all just clients.

## 4. Compute can attach at both ends without moving anything else

The point of fixing the contracts is that compute is a *deployment decision*, not an architecture change.

**Downstream: phones and small devices.**
A mobile app is a client of the nearest node: reads `/stats` and `/alerts`, writes `POST /readings` (phone
sensors, "burning here" reports; it carries the node's admin token, given once when the phone is paired), `POST /captures`
(photos, with the act token the phone is unlocked with) and `POST /actions` (I shut the windows; open to the household's phones). It needs no server of its own.
When on-device models arrive (classify a photo of smoke, run the tiny persistence model), they run against the same
endpoints. Federated participation, if ever wanted, is a `POST` of model deltas to the same node: the Flower
Android/iOS SDKs speak to a SuperNode that would sit next to the node's API. Nothing above the node changes.

**Upstream: clusters, data centres, frontier models.**
A model is two optional settings, both OpenAI-compatible: `AGENT_REMOTE_URL` for a bigger model on a machine of
yours, and `AGENT_ONLINE_URL` with a key for a frontier API. Point the remote one at Ollama on a laptop, or at vLLM
on a regional cluster (BSC for Barcelona, a partner HPC for Bali): the caller is identical. The node reads the
address and decides where the model is. Loopback, a private or tailnet address, or a name only a home network
knows, stays home. Anything else is online, so a regional cluster joins the tailnet to count as the household's
own, and at a public address it is used only once somebody here picks `fallback` or `strongest`, the choice an
online key needs too.

Jobs a node can't do itself, like Earth-model inference, federated training rounds or synthetic-control
computation for H0-T, need no new setting yet. A pack script that reads only its settings and writes files under
`out/<pack>/<node>/` can already run on any machine, a district aggregator with a GPU or a cloud runner, and
its results are read on the next poll once the folder is synced back. The `earth` scripts work this way.
`UPSTREAM_COMPUTE_URL`, a job submission endpoint, is a named contract with no code yet: it arrives with the
first job a node cannot run. The node never *needs* upstream compute; it *can use* it. Sovereignty is preserved
by what travels (hourly means, cells, model deltas: never raw) and by where a model is allowed to be.

**Peer: other observatories.**
An observatory instance that isn't ours (Bali Air Dispatch today; a city's own portal tomorrow) is a *source*.
Its readings enter through an adapter, flagged `local=false`, credited. If it exposes something like our read API,
one generic adapter reads it. This is how the network grows without owning everyone's data.

> Both model settings are read by `app/agent_loop.py`, for the Telegram bot, and by `app/ask.py`, for the
> dashboard's ask pane and the Wall. Earlier drafts of this page named the model setting `UPSTREAM_MODEL_URL`;
> no code ever read that name.

## 5. Where the Fab City Index plugs in

The Index has three ways data enters (index.fab.city methodology): observe, maintain data (adapters or operators),
run a campaign. The node is an **adapter that lives at the address**. Concretely:

The table below uses the Bali pilot because it is the one running. The same mapping applies at any site: swap the
named sources for whatever your place has, and where it has none, the global model still fills the reference row.

| cell (Bali pilot, as an example) | source at the node | state today |
|---|---|---|
| `Environmental\|Community` | local sensors: PM2.5 24h mean; days over WHO 24h in last 30d; sensor count | **live** as soon as node #1 runs 24h |
| `Governance\|Community` | ρ from the actions table; is a council/operator acknowledging alerts | **partial** until someone acts |
| `Economic\|Community` | businesses per km² within the kilometre, from OpenStreetMap (`packs/place`); `packs/make` reads fablabs.io to name workshops and fills no cell | **partial** |
| `Social\|Community` | participation: WhatsApp group size, campaign responses (Making Sense Bali pattern) | operator-entered; **mock → partial** |
| `Environmental\|City` | Bali Air Dispatch ambient means (peer observatory) + OpenAQ | **partial** (reference, not ours) |
| `Governance\|City` | Bali Satu Data open-data health, through the CKAN adapter (`CKAN_PORTALS` in `presets/bali.env`, `packs/open-data-health`) | **partial** |

`GET /cells` emits whatever the node can compute, each row carrying its `state`. The rows it cannot
compute are the more interesting half of the table, and the node carries the answer to them: a pinned
snapshot of `awesome-fabcity-data` lives at `data/sources/` and is served at `GET /sources`, so a cell
with no row can still say whether a source for it is registered and whether an adapter reads it. That
is how a cell with no adapter says so, as a query rather than as a sentence somebody wrote once.

A source entry is upstream's to change. Add one by PR to `awesome-fabcity-data`, wait for the merge,
then re-pin here with `tools/sync_registry.sh <merge sha>` and commit the diff (`docs/SOURCES.md`).
Nothing in this repo edits an entry, and `make lint` fails if anything did. The Airtable mirror follows
upstream, not this snapshot.

ρ is the brick nobody else has. Two generations of the Index measured a snapshot with ρ implicit at 1. The node
measures ρ, because it sends the alert and receives the acknowledgement, so every address running a node is a ρ
instrument. This is the H0-A hypothesis reduced to a table with four columns.

## 6. Staging, one stage at a time

Not a roadmap. Each stage names what exists, what it proves, and the trigger for the next.

**Stage 0: now.** One node, two containers by default (a broker, a Reticulum bridge, the local model's loop and IPFS
are optional profiles), Sense: adapters across sensor, portal, model and map classes, in the core and in packs.
Observe: Postgres, hourly view, read API. Act: two domain-blind core rules plus whatever the loaded packs contribute
(twenty-two core packs ship, and wild packs are added per node), to
Telegram, the mesh, and Home Assistant; `POST /actions` records what a person did.
Index: `GET /cells` emits `Environmental|Community` live and ρ partial. Compute: one Mac mini. *Proves:* a reading
becomes a message someone acts on, and the node reports that fact as a cell.
→ Trigger for Stage 1: five nodes alive 30 days, at least one `acted` row per node.

**Stage 1: a district.** One aggregator (City scale) receiving hourly means from five nodes over Tailscale.
Sense adds: AirGradient LAN adapter (our first outdoor units), Bali Satu Data. Observe adds: district map on
planetai.fab.city reading `/aggregates` and `/cells` from the aggregator. Act adds: advisory to the banjar; the first
fabrication ticket (a printed enclosure, an air-filter frame) with `fabricate` timestamped. Index: `*|City` cells for
Bali go partial→live. *Proves:* the same code runs at two scales and ρ is measurable across a district.
→ Trigger for Stage 2: a second pilot city asks to run it, or Fab Academy 2027 adopts the module.

**Stage 2: a second city, the observatory layer proper.** Barcelona node(s) on Smart Citizen's 15-year archive
+ Sentilo + Open Data BCN. The observatory reads two countries through one API. Upstream compute appears for real:
`AGENT_REMOTE_URL` → vLLM at BSC or ITDel, over the tailnet; a first federated round only if there is a model that averaging
cannot express. Index: two pilots' Community and City cells live; the phase plot (ΔFCI/Δt) gets its first two points.
→ Trigger for Stage 3: 30 nodes across ≥2 bioregions, a paying operator behind most.

**Stage 3: bioregion and planet as boundary conditions.** Partner-hosted bioregion servers publish context down
(hydrology, boundaries, Earth-model summaries). Community-council veto is a real gate on what the observatory
publishes. Mobile app ships as the domestic client. The Index publishes a quarterly ΔFCI/Δt per pilot.

## 7. Refusals that hold across stages

No raw readings leave the instance that recorded them. No cell is upgraded from mock or partial to live by
aggregation. No agent dispatches without a human row in `actions`. No layer requires a cloud provider to function.
No scale is skipped: a city aggregator is built from nodes, not declared from above.

The node's page is `doors.html` (the five doors), `mobile.html` (the phone page at `/?layout=mobile`) or `index.html` (the classic dashboard at `/?layout=classic`) and a fixed list of companion files served by name from `app/static/`, and stays
so: no framework, no build step, nothing loaded from anywhere else, because a node serves it to a household network
that may have no route out.
`planetai.fab.city` may use a framework; the two never share code, and both read the programme layer, which is
published as [`docs/site/design.md`](docs/site/design.md).
