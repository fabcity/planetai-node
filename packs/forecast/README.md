# forecast

**What it adds** — the next day of wind and rain for this point, from the meteorological agency that covers it.
It answers the question that follows "is the air bad": is it arriving or leaving. A reading of 40 µg/m³ with the
wind turning offshore and rain at four means something different from the same 40 with still air all night.

**It fetches. It does not predict.** Forecasting is the upstream tiers' job. This pack asks BMKG and Open-Meteo
what they already published, stores it beside the node's own readings, and stops.

## It never sends anything

One rule, `ahead`, with `contributes: report` and no message. It gives the daily report one line: where the wind
is coming from and when rain is expected. Nothing here can reach a phone.

That is deliberate and it is the whole design. On 7 September three wrong warnings reached node #1's Telegram at
21:17. A forecast pack that starts talking is the next batch of them: forecasts are wrong often, they are wrong
about the next day rather than about right now, and there is no action a household takes at 9pm because of rain
predicted for tomorrow that it would not take by looking out of the window. `tests/test_forecast.py` fails if any
rule here grows a level or a message.

**No cell, either.** A forecast is not measured here and is nobody's Index cell.

## The point, and proving it is this one

BMKG is addressed by `adm4`, a Permendagri 100.1.1-6117/2022 village code. Six digits of opaque: the only check
worth anything is where BMKG says the code is.

For node #1 it is **`51.03.05.2002`** — Bali / Badung / **Kuta Selatan / Ungasan**, −8.82548 / 115.15773, which
is **194 m** from the node. Note that Kuta Selatan is `51.03.05`, not `51.03.01`; `51.03.01` is Kuta, and its
nearest desa is 7 km away up the isthmus.

`planetai run forecast verify` resolves whatever code you set, prints the province, regency, district and village
it belongs to, and the distance from this node. Past 10 km the card says so on its face: a forecast for another
place is still a forecast, but it is not this address's.

BMKG allows 60 requests a minute per IP and it enforces it — finding the code above cost a `429` that took several
minutes to clear. `FORECAST_POLL_HOURS=6` is far inside it; BMKG publishes twice a day, so anything faster is
asking a cache the same question.

## Two sources, and only one of them is on

**BMKG** (`FORECAST_BMKG=1`, Indonesia). 3-hourly, three days, no key. `ws` is km/h, `wd_deg` is the direction the
wind comes **from**, `tp` is rain in millimetres for the step. BMKG publishes no probability, so the node does not
invent one. Attribution is required and is on the card and in the export.

**Open-Meteo** (`FORECAST_OPENMETEO=0`, anywhere). Hourly, no key, CC-BY 4.0. It is the portable half — it is what
makes this pack work for nodes #2 in Barcelona and #3 in Santiago, where BMKG does not. **Its free tier is
non-commercial use only.** That is the operator's decision and not ours, so it is off until it is turned on.

When both are on, a third derived channel records how far apart they are on temperature and wind for the same
hour. Neither is the truth; a wide gap is the node saying so out loud rather than picking a favourite.

## The issue time, stored per value

Every value is stored at its **valid** time with `fc_lead_hours` beside it: how far ahead of its own forecast it
is. A forecast without its issue time cannot be checked afterwards, and one that has quietly stopped refreshing
looks exactly like one that is right. `verify` fails if BMKG's `analysis_date` is more than 18 hours old, which
for a source that publishes twice a day means it has stalled.

Open-Meteo publishes no model run time. There is no `analysis_date` in its response and `generationtime_ms` is how
long the request took, not when the model ran. The node records when **it** fetched and labels it `fetched`, not
`issued`. Dressing a fetch time up as a model run would be inventing provenance.

## Channel roles

Every channel here is `derived`, none comparable — the same role `open-meteo-cams`' `pm25_model` carries in
`config/channels.yml`. A forecast is nobody's measurement of this place and must never pool with a sensor's
ambient reading. The `fc_` prefix is the second guard: no forecast metric shares a name with a measured one, so
even a mistake in the roles table cannot put a predicted temperature into an ambient average.

## What it assumes

That the node's coordinates are right, and — for BMKG — that the operator is in Indonesia and has set a code.
Without a code the pack logs one line and idles. A source that is down is never an alert.

## Scripts

```bash
planetai run forecast verify    # the code resolves to this point, units are as documented, the forecast is fresh
planetai run forecast fetch     # fetch now instead of waiting for the poll
planetai run forecast status    # the next day: wind, rain, temperature, and when it was issued
```
