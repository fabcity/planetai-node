"""The node's own copy of the AlphaEarth Satellite Embedding layers for its square of the planet, and the
year-over-year arithmetic on top of them.

Google publishes the Satellite Embedding dataset as Cloud-Optimized GeoTIFFs in a public bucket: one file per
UTM zone per year, 8192x8192 pixels at 10 m, 64 signed-8-bit channels, 2017-2025. This pack range-reads the
window around the node, keeps it under out/earth/, and compares two years pixel by pixel. Nothing is sent
anywhere; the node holds its own square.

kind='model', scale='city'. A Google artifact, mirrored under CC BY 4.0. Never a `live` cell.

The de-quantisation is not a scale factor. Each raw value maps to the analysis value by
    (v / 127.5) ** 2 * sign(v)
and the 64-vector has Euclidean length 1 AFTER that mapping, not before. Cosine arithmetic on the raw
integers is wrong by a factor of about 321 and silently plausible. Measured on 20,000 pixels of the Bali
tile: de-quantised norms 1.000093 +/- 0.002, raw norms ~321.

This module holds the shared work; the four scripts beside it are the commands. It imports numpy and rasterio
lazily so that a node without them loads the pack, logs once and idles.
