"""What is around this node, from OpenStreetMap, kept in PostGIS, summarised once a month.

Fetches everything OSM knows inside PLACE_RADIUS_M of the node (default 1000 m): buildings, shops and amenities, roads,
green space. Stores the geometries in PostGIS (the node's own database, with the extension), then answers a fixed set
of questions in SQL: how many buildings and how much of the ground they cover; how many places of each kind (food,
retail, education, health, worship, lodging, services); what share of buildings are commercial; kilometres of road;
share of green; distance to the nearest school, clinic, market. The answers are readings on sensor `place-point`,
kind `map`, scale `community`, so they appear in /observations, the dashboard and the bot like the sea and the land.

What this is: structure, and change between refreshes. What it is not: behaviour. Nobody should read "three warungs"
as "a busy street"; the sensors say what the street is doing.

Refreshes every PLACE_REFRESH_DAYS (30). Between refreshes the metrics are recomputed from the stored features, so a new
node has numbers on its first poll and an old one does not hammer Overpass. Data © OpenStreetMap contributors, ODbL.
