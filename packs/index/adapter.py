"""Reads this node's Fab City Index place, and the registry, once a day.

Two reads, both plain GETs of public files, neither carrying anything about the house:
  place     INDEX_URL/api/v0/places/<INDEX_PLACE>.json   what the Index says about the place (format fci-api-v0)
  registry  the commit sha of awesome-fabcity-data's main from GitHub, then that commit's index.json, converted to
            the entry shape app/registry.py reads. The body is fetched only when the sha has moved.

Each lands in one row of index_reads (what, sha, fetched_at, ok, error, body). A read that fails or is not what was
asked for never replaces the body: it keeps the last good one and says why in `error`, so a stale file reads as
stale instead of as empty. The pack stores and serves; it computes no score. fetch() returns no readings.
