"""Where the rivers are around this node, and which basins it drains into.

The node fetches its HydroSHEDS region once, on command: which region comes from the level-1 basins (a few MB each),
then the region's HydroRIVERS (50-110 MB) and its level-12 and level-4 HydroBASINS. It keeps what falls in its
square, plus its own basin at both levels, as one small json under out/hydro/, and deletes the downloads. Every
poll re-sends the figures for the nearest river: how far away it is, how much water it carries on average, its
order, the ground that drains into it, and how far it runs to the sea.

The geometry is HydroSHEDS v1 (Lehner & Grill 2013), shown under HydroATLAS v1.0's CC-BY 4.0 (Linke et al. 2019),
which publishes the same rivers and basins. HydroSHEDS' own download carries its v1 licence agreement, which forbids
distributing the data "as a stand-alone product"; the node fetches from there because HydroATLAS's figshare copy
(several GB) refuses scripted downloads, and it never passes the files on whole.

kind='model', scale='city'. Rivers are traced from a 15 arc-second (about 500 m) surface and drawn where at least
10 km2 drains or 0.1 m3/s flows, so a stream, a canal or a subak channel is not on this map; OpenStreetMap's are,
on the street map. Never an Index cell, never an alert. The level-4 basin is the bioregion index.fab.city draws.

pyshp is imported lazily, so a node without it loads the pack, logs once and idles.
