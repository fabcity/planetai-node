"""Where the rain goes around this node: its own square of elevation, filled and routed here, and the rain the
forecast puts on the ground that drains through it.

The elevation is Copernicus DEM GLO-30 (or GLO-90 where the 30 m tile is not public, or a GeoTIFF the operator
supplies), range-read once on command around the node and kept under out/terrain/. Two numbers come out of it for
the node's own pixel: how much ground drains through it, and how deep water would stand there before it runs on.
Every poll then sums the next 24 hours of `fc_rain` from ONE forecast source and multiplies.

kind='model', scale='city'. Region distance only: at 30 m a pixel is a street block, and the model is a SURFACE
model (roofs and canopy are in the heights). Never an Index cell, never an alert.

No wetness index and no percentile, on purpose. TWI is ln(a / tan b), and on a filled pixel tan b is clipped to
near zero, so the index is mostly the clip: at node #1 ln(1/0.001) was 6.9 of 12.74. A percentile ranks the square
against itself, so every square has a "wettest tenth". The two physical numbers TWI is made from need neither.

numpy and rasterio are imported lazily, so a node without them loads the pack, logs once and idles.
