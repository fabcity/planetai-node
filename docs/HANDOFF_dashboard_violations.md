# The six dashboard violations, removed

Released as **v0.36**, 7 September 2026. Tagged, pushed, tarball built. Node #1 was not touched: this was
rehearsed on Lima VMs and node #1 stays read-only over the tailnet.

## First, two corrections to the brief

**The repo was at v0.35, not v0.33.8.** `v0.34` and `v0.35` were already tagged on `main` when this started, and
`main` was `fd8b0c1`, the heat-rule fix. This work sits on top of that and released **v0.36**. If you were
expecting v0.33.9, that number is two releases behind the beta channel.

**`?only=` does not cover the wall.** It takes a band name: `plan`, `room`, `street`, `region`, `act`, `day`.
The wall is `?kiosk=1` or `#wall`. The wall shots below were taken with `?kiosk=1`. Passing `?only=` a name it
does not know hides every card and renders a blank page, which is how I found this. That is a small existing
bug and it is not fixed here.

## What shipped

| Violation | Now |
|---|---|
| `.bighex`, `.bighex2` — two large hexagons by `clip-path: polygon` | Deleted. The same pair on the wall view, `.wall .halo` and `.halo2`, went with them; they were the same violation under another name. |
| `.iso` — the isometric mesh as masked wallpaper at `opacity:.5` | Deleted, both instances. The second was inline on the Network view and was not in the brief. |
| Replacement for both | `app/static/node-ground.svg`, copied from `planetai-design/assets/h3/`. The node's resolution-8 cell `8895a4c86bfffff`, its seven resolution-9 children, its neighbours' edges leaving the frame. Drawn at 7–20% ink by the asset itself, not retinted, not tiled, served as a local file. `data-variant="dark"` is set on the root `<svg>`; nothing else in the file was changed. |
| `--hue: #7AC943` | Token removed. Colour is a role: green a response, red a line crossed, blue data or identity or a selected cell, orange what only the satellite knows, everything else ink. The big numeral is ink and turns red when the reading passes the line the sentence itself names, 15 µg/m³. |
| `.glow.b` — an animated radial gradient | Deleted, and so was `.glow.a`, the `v5drift` keyframe, the `linear-gradient` behind the settings save bar, and the sparkline's gradient fill and its `feGaussianBlur` glow pass. No gradients and no glows. |
| `.prov` — a pill at `border-radius:999px` with a coloured dot | Rebuilt as glyph plus word: square corners, `currentColor`, `--mute`, no colour token anywhere. The word is `model`, from the set `live` / `partial` / `model` / `cached` / `example`. |
| `.btn.act` in `var(--orange)` | Green. Pressing it is the response and that press is the ρ measurement. The act strip behind it stopped being an orange bar and became a bordered card. |

Also applied:

- **JetBrains Mono**, self-hosted at `app/static/fonts/jetbrains-mono-latin.woff2`. 31 kB, Latin subset,
  variable 100–800, one file for every weight. It carries every number, unit, timestamp, cell id and chip
  label. The fallback is `ui-monospace, SFMono-Regular, Menlo, monospace`.
- **The dark register's lifted blue.** This dashboard *is* the dark register, so `#20388D` was wired out and
  `#7FA5E8` in. `<html>` now carries `data-variant="dark"` so a check can tell which register it is looking at.
  Measured, from design-log A5: `#7FA5E8` on ink `#171717` is 7.21:1, `#20388D` on ink is 1.72:1, and
  `#7FA5E8` on paper `#F9F5F2` is 2.29:1, which is why it may never appear on paper.

The website palette is gone from the JavaScript too, not only the stylesheet. The map's nine use-colours, the
four Fab City Index pillar rings and the Network view's flow lines all carried `#7AC943`, `#3FA9F5` or
`#E8873A`. Uses are now blue and told apart by their label. The pillar rings are blue and tell live from
derived by dash length, which is the rule the design log already set: state travels by weight, fill and dash,
never by hue. Red for the economy pillar and green for the environment pillar said things the numbers did not.

## Before and after

`docs/design/shots/`, captured on a Lima VM running the merged code, not a mock.

| | 1440 | 390 |
|---|---|---|
| Here band, before | `here-1440-before.jpg` | `here-390-before.jpg` |
| Here band, after | `here-1440-after.jpg` | `here-390-after.jpg` |
| Wall, before | `wall-1440-before.jpg` | — |
| Wall, after | `wall-1440-after.jpg` | — |

The wall pair is the clearest of the six: a green hexagon roughly nine hundred pixels across sat on top of the
sentence, and a green glow filled the bottom right corner. Both are gone and the cell sits beside the sentence
instead of over it.

They are JPEG at one device pixel, not retina PNG. The first capture was 12 MB of PNG, which went into the
tarball every beta tester downloads and took it from under a megabyte to twelve.

## The gates, and how each was proven to fail

`tools/check_ui.py` was extended, not replaced. It already runs in `make lint`.
`tests/test_check_ui.py` breaks each rule against a copy of the real `index.html` and requires the check to
name it. It runs in `make test`. All thirteen mutations are caught:

| Rule | Broken with | Caught as |
|---|---|---|
| Six-vertex `clip-path` above 24px | the real `.bighex` pasted back in | `.hero .bighex is a six-sided clip-path wider than 24px` |
| …but not the small glyph | `.alert .hex` widened to 24px | passes, as it should |
| Website palette | `--hue:#7AC943` in `:root` | `#7AC943 (web-green) is in the stylesheet` |
| Website palette | `#3FA9F5` on the ρ arc | `#3FA9F5 (web-blue) is in the markup` |
| Gradients | the real `.glow` rule pasted back in | `radial-gradient() is in the stylesheet` |
| Radius, control | a new `.newbtn{border-radius:999px}` | `rounds a control to 999px; the limit is 8px` |
| Radius, card | a new `.panel{border-radius:26px}` | `rounds a card to 26px; the limit is 18px` |
| Provenance colour | `.prov{color:var(--green)}` | `.prov carries a colour (--green)` |
| Provenance colour, inline | `style="color:#00A057"` on the mark | `prov in its class or id carries an inline colour` |
| Orange off the satellite | the act button back to `var(--orange)` | `line 156 paints with orange away from the satellite layer` |
| Fab Blue on ink | `--blue:#20388D` | `uses Fab Blue #20388D in the dark register` |
| Lifted blue off the dark register | `data-variant="dark"` removed | `uses the lifted blue #7FA5E8 outside the dark register` |
| An asset the node does not serve | `src="node-ground.svg"` | `not under static/ — app/main.py serves nothing else` |
| An asset off the allowlist | `src="static/ground2.svg"` | `COMPANIONS allowlist does not serve` |

The last two are a gate the brief did not ask for. I added it because I shipped that exact bug while doing
this: the app serves `index.html` and nothing beside it, so the ground and the font 404'd silently and the hero
came up empty. `app/main.py` now serves them by name from a two-entry allowlist, with the same
`no-cache, must-revalidate` header `index.html` already has, and for the same reason it has it.

### Three scope decisions, and what they cost

The radius, palette and hexagon rules as written in the brief catch far more than the six. Confirmed with
Tomas before writing them:

1. **Radius is scoped to new code.** Written literally, the rule fails on fourteen pill controls and five 30px
   card rules that the design log never called violations. They are in `RADIUS_LEGACY` in `check_ui.py`, dated
   7 September, with a note that the list may shrink and may not grow. A new pill fails the build; the existing
   ones are recorded debt, not silence.
2. **The map's use-colours went to blue.** Nine categories, four of them painted in role colours. Which use a
   dot is now belongs to its label, and eventually to the design kit's signs.
3. **The small hexagon glyph stays.** The bullet on every alert and sensor row is 8–12px and carries the
   alert's level. The gate fails above 24px, which is the same reasoning the design kit's own hexagon check
   uses for small cells.

## What I did not touch

- **Layout, spacing and the type scale.** Every grid, every `clamp()`, every band and card position is as it
  was. Those come from the programme layer.
- **The three-colour ribbon under the hero.** `.hero .tri` is a 3px bar in red, blue and green, and with the
  glows and the green hexagon gone it is now the most saturated thing on the page. It is decoration in the
  role palette, and a permanent red stripe undercuts red meaning a line was crossed. It was not on the list of
  six, and the scope calls above were all "narrow", so it stayed. To remove it: delete the `.hero .tri` rule
  and its `<div class="tri">` in the markup, two lines. Your call.
- **Figtree and Funnel Sans still load from Google Fonts.** Only JetBrains Mono is on the node. On a LAN with
  no route out the numbers are right and the headings fall back to `system-ui`. That was true before this
  change and the brief only asked for the mono, but the offline claim is not whole until those two are
  self-hosted as well.
- **Alert strings.** None were added or changed, so nothing new needed `en`, `id` and `es`. `config/rules.yml`
  is untouched.
- **Node #1.** Read-only over the tailnet throughout.

## Four things found on the way

1. **`node-ground.svg` is node #1's cell, on every node.** The design kit's copy is captioned
   `8895a4c86bfffff · RES 8 · 531 M EDGE · THE CELL THIS NODE STANDS IN`. That is true in Kuta Selatan and
   false everywhere else. I saw it rendered on a Barcelona node at 390px and the shipped copy no longer
   carries the caption. The geometry stands in for every node's cell and now claims nothing. The real fix is
   to generate the ground from each node's own lat and lon, which needs H3 in the app and is its own piece of
   work.
2. **`planetai update` blames the backup when Docker is the problem.** On a machine where the user cannot
   reach the Docker socket it prints `backup failed — not updating`, which sends you to the backup. The real
   cause is one line up. `install.sh` already has the right message for this at line 70; `update.sh` does not.
3. **An unknown `?only=` value renders a blank page** rather than falling back to the whole view.
4. **`AGENTS.md` says "`cells[].state`: green is measured, blue derived or modelled".** The pillar rings no
   longer follow that, because green now means a loop closed. The rings tell live from derived by dash. That
   line in `AGENTS.md` should be settled one way or the other.

## Rehearsal

Both paths reached the new dashboard with no manual step.

- **Fresh install from the site line**, on a wiped VM with no `~/planetai`: driven through a pty by
  `drive_install.py`, the way a stranger types it, against the real tarball served over HTTP with
  `PLANETAI_SITE` pointed at it and `PLANETAI_REPO` made unreachable so it took the tarball path beta testers
  take. 79 seconds. Doctor green apart from `telegram connected` and `a backup exists`, both expected on a node
  minutes old. `/`, `/static/node-ground.svg` and `/static/jetbrains-mono-latin.woff2` all 200. Zero matches
  for `bighex`, `--hue`, `#7AC943`, `radial-gradient(` or `#3FA9F5` in the page it serves.
- **`planetai update` from the previous version**, on a VM installed at v0.35 with 4,514 readings in its
  database: backup taken, schema applied, image rebuilt, containers restarted, `updated. Nothing was lost:
  4,540 readings, 3 alerts, 0 actions.` It now reports `v0.36` on `/health` and serves the new page.

`make lint && make test` pass, and were run before each commit.

## The two sentences

> Lucas — the six violations are out of the shipped dashboard as of v0.36, and `node-ground.svg` is the hero's
> ground on both the Here band and the wall. Seven checks now fail the build if any of them come back, and
> each one was broken on purpose against the real page before I trusted it.

> Vivanco — colour on the node dashboard is a role now, not an accent: green is a response, red is a line
> crossed, blue is data, orange is satellite-only, everything else is ink. That means the four Fab City Index
> pillar rings no longer have a colour each, and tell live from derived by dash instead.
