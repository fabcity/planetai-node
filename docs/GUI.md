# The dashboard

One page the node serves at `/`. No build step, no framework, no account, and no connection to
anywhere else — a node hands this page to the machine you are reading it on, and if the house has no
route to the internet it still works.

```bash
planetai ui        # the URLs, and the token that unlocks Set up
```

## The shape of it

The node works in a loop of four:

1. **Observe** — what is read, seen and heard about this place.
2. **Decide** — what to do about it.
3. **Act** — what has been asked, of whom.
4. **Measure** — whether it worked, and how long it took.

Every part of the page belongs to one of those four and is drawn under it. The heads carry no numbers, because
Now does not draw them in the loop's order: it opens with Decide, since what asks for a person is read first,
then Observe as the evidence for it, then Act and Measure. If a part has
nothing to show — no sensor for it, a pack you have not installed — it prints one line saying which,
and never a blank or a zero standing in for a reading nobody took.

## The first screen

**The ladder, across the top.** Eleven rungs, one per resolution your node knows: resolution 2 is 172 km
to an edge, resolution 12 is 10 m, and the one you are standing on is lit. Rungs coarse enough that the
cell could leave your machine are textured; rungs finer than your node is willing to say where it is
are struck through. Press one and the whole page re-answers at that resolution.

The ladder is one row. Under it a single chip, *one cell here*, opens what one cell at that rung is worth:
a ruler from 10 m to 200 km, the key to the two textures, three hexagons to scale (the rung you are on
against the one above and the one below), and what each thing your node speaks for costs to cover at it. Open it and step the ladder: at resolution 4 the sea takes five cells and your
house takes one, and so does everything in between. That is the whole argument for resolution in one
table.

**Then the thing that matters.** The issue with most to say, as a sentence in your language, with its
number beside it at the size of a headline — *"The house is keeping the heat out."*
Under it, one plain sentence carries the figures — *"In the house it is 33.9, and on the street 30.7.
The line is 35, and nothing here is over it."* — and why that issue and not another. Then one rule between the issue's own two
ends, a dot on it for each distance (the house, the street, the ring, the region) and the line in red
where the issue has one, so you can see at a glance whether it is you or whether it is everywhere.
The four distances in full are in the table further down. The line at the end of the lead says what is
open, in words, and links to Decide: *1 event open · heat · sustained since 13:00 · in Decide*, or *nothing
open · 2 cleared today*.

**Then Decide.** One card for each alert event that is open, and nothing else above the evidence. An event is
one issue in one house, from when its rule first fires to when it clears. The card has the peak with what it
is compared to (the usual at this hour, outside, the line), the one action your node chose, in its words, and
three buttons: **Done**, **Not now** and **Doesn't fit**. Done closes the loop. Not now holds the card for
three hours unless the reading reaches danger. Doesn't fit asks what you did instead. The message the node sent
is under them, and so are links to the evidence: the issue at every distance, the day, the stations. A node that
has not been switched to events keeps its alert cards, with **I did this** on them, and says so.

Beside it, the ground: the map cell this node stands in, its six neighbours and the seven smaller
cells inside it, with the buildings and roads of your own square kept on your own disk. The line
under it is the cell's id — `8839446033fffff · RES 8 · 497 M EDGE` — which is how this node's
readings find their place without anybody being told where you live.

## What you will find further down

- **Every issue at every distance**, as a table. Where a cell is empty it says why: *no kit outside
  on the street*, *no public station reporting*.
- **The day this place just had** — one drawing per issue of the last 24 hours at every distance, with the usual for
  each hour, the hours over the line, and the alert event and its answer, and under it a strip of the last seven days,
  one cell an hour. Point at an hour to read it in words.
- **What this page is made of** (on Network) — your own stations, the borrowed ones faint, what only the satellite
  knows in orange, counted in signs rather than drawn as a chart.
- **What this page asked of the world while you looked at it** (on Network). The offline plan asks nothing.
  Switching the map to satellite asks twelve times, and tells that server which five kilometres of
  the planet you are looking at. Your node's own polls are counted apart, because they happen
  whether or not anybody is at the screen.
- **What was asked, and what was answered** — one ring for each event of the last seven days, closed if
  somebody answered it, with the action your node sent and the answer beside it. And, when your node knows
  one, the nearest place to make or fix something.
- **Whether it worked** — the share of alerts that got an answer, drawn as one ring per alert rather than
  one long bar, with the median minutes to the first answer. It is the one number on the page that
  comes from a person.
- **What this node will not do, at any stage** — five refusals, as signs, at the foot.

Everything that wants to explain itself is folded into one band at the very bottom, *Where these
numbers come from*. A household that wants to know why is one scroll away; one that does not is never
interrupted.

## The six tabs

| tab | URL | what it answers |
|---|---|---|
| **Now** | `/` | What is the air, the heat, the land and the coast doing here, this hour? |
| **Historical** | `#historical` | What has this place looked like over the years the satellite has watched it, and how far back does each source go? |
| **Network** | `#network` | What is this node connected to, what does it hear, what could it read, and what may it say and send? |
| **Wall** | `#wall` | The same node at three metres, for a screen on a wall. Dark, and it stays dark. |
| **Arrange** | `#arrange` | Which sections Now shows, and in what order. Saved on the node. |
| **Set up** | `#setup` | Every setting, what it does, and where its value came from. Needs the token. |

## How much of it you want to see

Three modes, in the header:

- **Simple** — the three things a person in the house asks: is it fine, is anything changing, is there
  something to do. One number with its rule, one plain sentence, the open event's action with its three
  buttons, the
  ground, and one paragraph your node writes. The other issues sit on one line under it; press one to
  look at it, and **back** to return to the one your node picked. If your node is too old to send the
  paragraph, the page says so and names the version rather than making one up.
- **Advanced** — the whole page. This is the default.
- **Learn** — the whole page with a small question mark at each part. Press one and the ask pane
  opens with a card that quotes your node's own documentation for that part, word for word, and says
  which page the words came from; **next** walks you to the next mark. Every section has one, and so
  does the foot. The words are built into the page, so it works with no way out to the internet;
  the link is an offer, not the answer.

The mode is remembered by the browser you chose it in, so a phone and a wall screen can disagree.
`?mode=simple` on the end of any URL shows one without remembering it, which is how you send somebody
the short answer without changing their page.

## Paper or dark

Beside the modes: **Paper** or **Dark**. Paper is the default, because most of the time this is read
in a room with light in it.

The page does not guess. It does not follow the operating system and it does not watch the clock — if
you want it dark at noon it stays dark. The choice is remembered by the browser you made it in and
changes nothing for anybody else in the house.

The Wall is the one exception: it is always dark, because a lit white rectangle in a dark room is a
lamp, and nobody chose a lamp. There is also almost nothing to press on the wall: **back**, and the
variables in its top bar. That is deliberate: the wall is an instruction, not a control.

## Ask the node

Right of the modes (in the foot on a phone), **ask the node** opens a pane that asks the model named
under Set up → Model, the one the Telegram bot uses, about what the page shows. It reads and changes
nothing: a change it suggests is a card somebody presses. Its header says which model answers and where
that model runs, and nothing asked there is kept. With no model it still searches the documentation.
`UI_ASK=off` removes it for everybody. [Ask the node](site/ask.md) has the rest.

## Changing the order

**Arrange** is Now in another mode. Each section grows three controls — move it within its stage,
hide it, restore it — and *Done* saves the order to the node, for every screen in the house. The
ladder, the lead and the ground do not move, and the bar says so.

That changes the order of the *sections*. To change which issues your node watches at all, and in
what order, that is `NODE_ISSUES` under **Set up → Basics** — a list, most important first.

## If something moves, it is because a reading moved

Nothing on this page animates for its own sake. A number that has just arrived fades in over 120 ms
and pulses once; a ring closes when somebody answers an alert; a satellite year holds for four seconds
before the next. Every one of those durations is named after the thing that drives it, and if you
have asked your machine for less motion, all of them stop. The list is on the
[Design](site/design.md) page.

While the page is waiting for your node to answer, it draws the one motion that is not about a
reading: a globe of the sixteen characters a map cell id is written in, turning inside your own cell,
with the list of things it is asking for and how many milliseconds each took. It settles into the
plane of that cell the moment the answer arrives, and leaves.

## Seeing it without a node

Every view can be drawn from a committed snapshot, which is how the page is reviewed and how a
problem gets looked at on somebody else's machine:

```bash
python3 tools/preview.py     # http://127.0.0.1:8123
```

`?fixture=<name>` replays a snapshot through the node's own engine and the pill says `cached`.
`?state=empty` shows a node with nothing on it yet; `?state=refused` shows what a reader with no
token sees. None of those four remember anything, so any of them can be sent to somebody without
changing their own page.
