# Alert events, part 1: the decision engine in shadow — Implementation Plan

> **For agentic workers:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use superpowers:subagent-driven-development (recommended) or superpowers:executing-plans to implement this plan task-by-task. Steps use checkbox (`- [ ]`) syntax for tracking.

**Goal:** Build the event layer from `docs/SPEC_alerts.md` (§2–§5, §9, `ALERT_ENGINE`), run it in shadow beside
today's rules, and prove it against node #1's last 30 days before anything reaches a phone.

**Architecture:** Rules stay SQL. Two new core views give rules the measures they lack (`recent_15m`,
`usual_by_hour`). Kinded rules (`kind:` + `issue:`) produce candidate rows. A pure-Python engine
(`app/events.py`) folds candidates into one event per issue per house, decides open/escalate/clear, quiet hours and
the daily ceiling, and picks one action from the context. The same engine runs in the app (Postgres store) and in
the replay (memory store, DuckDB-run rules), so what is replayed is what ships. `ALERT_ENGINE=rules` (default)
changes nothing; `shadow` records what the engine would send and sends nothing.

**Tech Stack:** Python 3.12 app (stdlib + psycopg + PyYAML), Postgres 16 / PostGIS, DuckDB for replays (dev only),
plain-assert test suites run by `tests/all`.

**Spec:** `docs/SPEC_alerts.md`. Read it first; this plan implements its §11 steps 1–4 and the `ALERT_ENGINE`
switch. Telegram buttons and ρ (§7), anticipation (§6) and report settings (§10 except `ALERT_ENGINE`,
`ALERT_MAX_PER_DAY`, `HOME_HAS`) are plans 2–4.

## Global Constraints

- Work in your own git worktree off `origin/main`, never the checkout holding `main` (`skills/preflight/SKILL.md`).
- `make lint && make test` before every commit; the pre-commit hook runs both. Never `--no-verify`.
- `init.sql` is applied twice by CI and on every update: everything idempotent (`IF NOT EXISTS`, `DROP … IF EXISTS`
  before `CREATE VIEW`). Additive only: no dropped columns, no renames. A new `schema_version` row, `0.53`.
  `GOVERNANCE.md`: `init.sql` changes need two maintainers — say so in the PR body.
- Rule SQL runs as `planetai_ro` (SELECT only, no `settings`). Every new view gets `GRANT SELECT … TO planetai_ro`.
- Rules read local hours through the session time zone (`current_setting('TimeZone')`), which the app sets to
  `NODE_TZ`. Replays pin `Asia/Makassar` (`tests/trustdb.py`).
- `ALERT_ENGINE` default is `rules`, and with it the node behaves exactly as before: same rules, same sends.
- Old rules are not edited or removed in this plan. Kinded rules are new rules beside them; the old path skips any
  rule with a `kind:`.
- Messages in en, id and es with the same placeholders (`tests/test_packs.py`). The id and es strings are
  assistant-written; say so in a comment, as `app/issues/heat.yml` does.
- A new test suite is one line in `tests/all` and moves the expected count (55 today) by one, in the same commit.
  A suite ends in its last `print`, never `sys.exit()` with tests below it.
- Every new setting: `app/settings.py` (`RUNTIME` + `CHOICES`), `.env.example` (comment above the key),
  and a row in `docs/site/configuration.md` — `tools/check_docs.py` fails otherwise.
- Starting values (spec §3) are constants with a comment naming them as starting values; the replay sets them.
- Never import `main` in a process on node #1; never write to node #1. The replay data is fetched read-only and
  stays out of git (household data).
- Commit identity: `git -c user.name="Tomas Diez" -c user.email="tomas@fab.city" commit …`, trailer

### Task 1: The measures — `recent_15m` and `usual_by_hour`

**Files:**
- Modify: `init.sql` (append a block at the end)
- Modify: `app/main.py` (one loop, one function)
- Modify: `tests/trustdb.py` (build the two views at the replayed instant)
- Create: `tests/test_measures.py`
- Modify: `tests/all` (one line, count 55 → 56)

**Interfaces:**
- Produces (SQL, readable by rules): `recent_15m(bucket timestamptz, sensor_id text, metric text, mean double)` —
  15-minute means over the last 24 h for `kind='sensor'`, plus derived rows `metric='apparent'` (Steadman, as
  `packs/heat/rules.yml`) wherever a sensor has `temp` and `humidity` in the same bucket.
- Produces: `usual_by_hour(sensor_id text, metric text, hour int, median double, p75 double, p90 double, n bigint)` —
  per local hour, over the last 14 days of hourly means, metrics `temp`, `humidity`, `pm25`, `apparent`.
- Produces (Python): `trustdb.Node.refresh_usual(at: datetime)`; `Node.run()` rebuilds `recent_15m` at `at`.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing test**

`tests/test_measures.py`:

```python
"""The core measures a kinded rule reads: recent_15m and usual_by_hour (docs/SPEC_alerts.md §3).

```

- [ ] **Step 2: Run it to verify it fails**

Run: `PYTHONPATH=tests python3 tests/test_measures.py`
Expected: FAIL with `AttributeError: 'Node' object has no attribute 'refresh_usual'`.

- [ ] **Step 3: Add the views to `init.sql`**

Append at the end of `init.sql`, after every existing block (the `planetai_ro` role exists by then):

```sql
-- The measures a kinded rule reads (docs/SPEC_alerts.md §3). A rule asks "for how long" and "against what usual"
-- here instead of rebuilding either from raw readings every minute.
--
-- recent_15m: quarter-hour means over the last 24 h, sensors only, with `apparent` (Steadman's no-wind indoor

DROP VIEW IF EXISTS recent_15m CASCADE;
CREATE VIEW recent_15m AS
WITH b AS (
  SELECT date_trunc('hour', r.ts) + CAST(floor(extract(minute FROM r.ts) / 15) AS INTEGER) * INTERVAL '15 minutes' AS bucket,
         r.sensor_id, r.metric, avg(r.value) AS mean
  FROM readings r JOIN sensors s ON s.sensor_id = r.sensor_id
  WHERE r.ts > now() - INTERVAL '24 hours' AND s.kind = 'sensor'
  GROUP BY 1, 2, 3)
SELECT bucket, sensor_id, metric, mean FROM b
UNION ALL
SELECT t.bucket, t.sensor_id, 'apparent',
       t.mean + 0.33 * (h.mean / 100.0 * 6.105 * exp(17.27 * t.mean / (237.7 + t.mean))) - 4.0

WHERE t.metric = 'temp';

DROP MATERIALIZED VIEW IF EXISTS usual_by_hour;
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW usual_by_hour AS
WITH h AS (
  SELECT date_trunc('hour', r.ts) AS bucket, r.sensor_id, r.metric, avg(r.value) AS mean
  FROM readings r JOIN sensors s ON s.sensor_id = r.sensor_id
  WHERE r.ts > now() - INTERVAL '14 days' AND s.kind = 'sensor' AND r.metric IN ('temp', 'humidity', 'pm25')
  GROUP BY 1, 2, 3),
a AS (
  SELECT bucket, sensor_id, metric, mean FROM h

         t.mean + 0.33 * (u.mean / 100.0 * 6.105 * exp(17.27 * t.mean / (237.7 + t.mean))) - 4.0
  FROM h t JOIN h u ON u.sensor_id = t.sensor_id AND u.bucket = t.bucket AND u.metric = 'humidity'
  WHERE t.metric = 'temp')
SELECT sensor_id, metric, CAST(extract(hour FROM bucket) AS INTEGER) AS hour,
       percentile_cont(0.5)  WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY mean) AS median,
       percentile_cont(0.75) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY mean) AS p75,
       percentile_cont(0.9)  WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY mean) AS p90,

WITH NO DATA;
GRANT SELECT ON recent_15m, usual_by_hour TO planetai_ro;
INSERT INTO schema_version (version) VALUES ('0.53') ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING;
```

- [ ] **Step 4: Teach the replay harness both views**

In `tests/trustdb.py`, add after `_stats_sql()`:

```python
def _measures_sql() -> tuple[str, str]:
    """recent_15m and usual_by_hour verbatim from init.sql, for DuckDB. The materialized view becomes a table built
    at the replayed instant (DuckDB has no materialized views), and `WITH NO DATA` goes with it."""
    sql = _schema()
    recent = re.search(r"CREATE VIEW recent_15m AS.*?;", sql, re.S).group(0)
    usual = re.search(r"CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW usual_by_hour AS(.*?)WITH NO DATA;", sql, re.S).group(1)
    return recent, "CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE usual_by_hour AS" + usual
```

and to `class Node`:

```python
    def refresh_usual(self, at: dt.datetime) -> None:
        """Rebuild usual_by_hour as it would read at `at` (the app refreshes it hourly)."""
        self.con.execute(_measures_sql()[1].replace("now()", f"TIMESTAMPTZ '{at.isoformat()}'"))

    def recent(self, at: dt.datetime) -> list[tuple]:
        """recent_15m as it would read at `at`."""
        self._recent_at(at)
        return self.con.execute("SELECT bucket, sensor_id, metric, mean FROM recent_15m").fetchall()

    def _recent_at(self, at: dt.datetime) -> None:
        self.con.execute("DROP VIEW IF EXISTS recent_15m")
        self.con.execute(_measures_sql()[0].replace("now()", f"TIMESTAMPTZ '{at.isoformat()}'"))
```

and in `Node.run()`, after the `stats` view is rebuilt:

```python
        self._recent_at(at)
```

- [ ] **Step 5: Run the test**

Run: `PYTHONPATH=tests python3 tests/test_measures.py`
Expected: two lines, the last starting `usual_by_hour: 24 local hours`. If DuckDB rejects
`CAST(... AS INTEGER) * INTERVAL '15 minutes'`, write the bucket as
`date_trunc('hour', r.ts) + (CAST(extract(minute FROM r.ts) AS INTEGER) / 15) * INTERVAL '15 minutes'` in
`init.sql` (integer division in both engines) and rerun — never a DuckDB-only edit in the harness.

- [ ] **Step 6: Refresh it from the app**

In `app/main.py`, beside `run_rules`:

```python
def refresh_usual() -> None:
    """usual_by_hour is materialized (init.sql): rebuild it hourly, in this connection's NODE_TZ, so a rule's
    "usual for this hour" is the household's hour. Concurrent readers keep the old rows until it finishes."""
    with db() as con, con.cursor() as cur:
        cur.execute("REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW usual_by_hour")
```

and register it with the other loops (after `loop(run_rules, 60, delay=30)`):

```python
loop(refresh_usual, 3600, delay=10)
```

- [ ] **Step 7: Prove the schema twice against a real Postgres, and register the suite**

Run (any scratch Postgres 16 with PostGIS, e.g. the one in `memory`/`docs/site/developing.md`):
`psql "$SCRATCH_DB" -f init.sql && psql "$SCRATCH_DB" -f init.sql && psql "$SCRATCH_DB" -c "REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW usual_by_hour"`
Expected: no error on either run, and the refresh succeeds on an empty `readings`.

In `tests/all`, add beside the other replays:

```
test_measures|PYTHONPATH=tests python3 tests/test_measures.py
```

add `test_measures` to `EXPECTED_SKIPS` (it skips without duckdb, like `test_season`), and change both `55`s in the
count lines to `56`.

- [ ] **Step 8: Run lint and test, commit**

Run: `make lint && make test`
Expected: `ok` from lint; `56 suites: 56 passed`.

```bash
git add init.sql app/main.py tests/trustdb.py tests/test_measures.py tests/all
git commit -m "measures: recent_15m and usual_by_hour, for rules that ask how long and against what usual"
```

### Task 2: The engine — candidates to events to messages (pure)

**Files:**
- Create: `app/events.py`
- Create: `tests/test_events.py`
- Modify: `tests/all` (count 56 → 57)

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: nothing from Task 1 (pure).
- Produces:
  - `Candidate(rule_id: str, issue: str, kind: str, level: str, sensor_id: str, room: str, value: float, line: float, over: bool, where: str = "inside")`
  - `Event` (fields below), `Message(event: Event, reason: str, send: bool, held: str | None)`
  - `Policy(quiet: tuple[int, int] | None, max_per_day: int, alert_level: str)`
  - `MemoryStore()` with `open_events() -> list[Event]`, `save(e: Event) -> Event`, `sends_on(day: date) -> int`,
    `count_send(day: date) -> None`
  - `step(now: datetime, cands: list[Candidate], store, policy: Policy) -> list[Message]`
  - constants `KIND_RANK`, `ESCALATE_GAP`, `CLEAR_AFTER`, `ESCALATE_STEP`

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing test**

`tests/test_events.py`:

```python
"""The event engine (docs/SPEC_alerts.md §4): one event per issue per house; open, escalate, match, clear; quiet

A kinded rule's row is a Candidate. Every candidate is folded into the one open Event for its issue (heat, air…)

value clearly passes its peak, and clears when no candidate (over or inside the margin) has been seen for
CLEAR_AFTER. A margin row — `over` False — keeps an open event open and never opens one: that is the hysteresis.

Whether a message is sent: quiet hours send only `danger`; outside `danger`, at most Policy.max_per_day pushes a
local day; ALERT_LEVEL decides whether a warn event interrupts at all. A held message is still returned, with the
reason, because the report carries it. The same function runs in the app (events_pg.py) and in the replay

- [ ] **Step 4: Run the test**

Run: `PYTHONPATH=app python3 tests/test_events.py`
Expected: eight lines ending `events: one story per issue, silent matches, hysteresis, quiet hours, a ceiling, ALERT_LEVEL`.

- [ ] **Step 5: Register and commit**

`tests/all`: add `test_events|PYTHONPATH=app python3 tests/test_events.py`; count 56 → 57 in both places.

Run: `make lint && make test` — expected `57 suites: 57 passed`.

```bash
git add app/events.py tests/test_events.py tests/all
git commit -m "events: the engine that folds rule rows into one story per issue per house"

### Task 3: Postgres store, schema, `ALERT_ENGINE`, and shadow wiring

**Files:**
- Modify: `init.sql` (append after Task 1's block)
- Create: `app/events_pg.py`
- Modify: `app/main.py` (`run_rules`)
- Modify: `app/settings.py`, `.env.example`, `docs/site/configuration.md`
- Modify: `tools/check_docs.py` (remove `ALERT_ENGINE` from `PROPOSED["docs/SPEC_alerts.md"]`)
- Test: `tests/test_events_pg.py` (new), `tests/all` (57 → 58)

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `events.step`, `events.Candidate`, `events.Event`, `events.Policy` (Task 2).
- Produces:
  - tables `events`, `event_messages`; columns `alerts.event_id`, `actions.event_id`; stage `dismissed`
  - `events_pg.PgStore(cur)` — the four `MemoryStore` methods, persisted
  - `events_pg.candidates(rule: dict, rows: list[dict]) -> list[events.Candidate]`
  - `events_pg.policy() -> events.Policy` from settings
  - `events_pg.run(cur, cands: list[Candidate], mode: str, now: datetime) -> list[events.Message]` — records
    every message in `event_messages`; sends only when `mode == "events"` (sending itself is wired in Plan 2;
    in this plan `events` mode logs and does not notify — see Step 6)
  - settings `ALERT_ENGINE` (`rules`|`shadow`|`events`, default `rules`), `ALERT_MAX_PER_DAY` (default `4`),
    `HOME_HAS` (comma list of `purifier`, `ac`, `fan`, `windows`; default empty)

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing test**

`tests/test_events_pg.py` — pure parts only (`make test` has no Postgres; the store is proved in Step 7):

```python
"""events_pg without a database: rule rows become Candidates, and settings become a Policy.
Run: PYTHONPATH=app python3 tests/test_events_pg.py
"""
import os

os.environ.setdefault("DATABASE_URL", "postgresql://x:x@127.0.0.1:1/x")
import events_pg as P  # noqa: E402

rule = {"id": "heat/heat_sustained", "kind": "sustained", "issue": "heat", "level": "act"}
rows = [{"sensor_id": "sc-1", "name": "K ROOM", "value": 36.1, "line": 35, "over": True},
        {"sensor_id": "sc-2", "name": "L ROOM", "value": 34.5, "line": 35, "over": False}]
cs = P.candidates(rule, rows)
assert [(c.room, c.over) for c in cs] == [("K ROOM", True), ("L ROOM", False)], cs
assert cs[0].issue == "heat" and cs[0].kind == "sustained" and cs[0].where == "inside"
assert P.candidates({"id": "air-quality/x", "level": "act"}, rows) == [], "a rule without kind: is report-only"
print("  rows of a kinded rule become candidates; a rule without kind: gives none")

rule2 = {"id": "air-quality/air_spike", "kind": "spike", "level": "warn"}
c2 = P.candidates(rule2, [{"sensor_id": "o", "name": "OUT", "value": 40, "line": 12, "over": True, "where": "outside"}])
assert c2[0].issue == "air" and c2[0].where == "outside", "issue defaults from the pack's domain; where passes through"
print("  issue defaults from the pack (air-quality -> air); where passes through")

os.environ.update(QUIET_HOURS="1", QUIET_FROM="22", QUIET_TO="6", ALERT_MAX_PER_DAY="4", ALERT_LEVEL="warn")
pol = P.policy()
assert pol.quiet == (22, 6) and pol.max_per_day == 4 and pol.alert_level == "warn", pol
os.environ["QUIET_HOURS"] = "0"
assert P.policy().quiet is None
print("events_pg: candidates from kinded rules, a Policy from settings")
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Run it to verify it fails**

Run: `PYTHONPATH=app python3 tests/test_events_pg.py`
Expected: FAIL with `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'events_pg'`.

- [ ] **Step 3: Schema**

Append to `init.sql` (still version `0.53`, which Task 1 inserted):

```sql
-- Events (docs/SPEC_alerts.md §4): one row per story — one issue at one house, from open to clear. Every alert
-- row still exists; the ones that fed an event point at it. event_messages is every message the engine decided,
-- sent or held, with the reason: in ALERT_ENGINE=shadow nothing is sent and this table is the comparison.
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS events (
  id           BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  issue        TEXT NOT NULL,
  kind         TEXT NOT NULL,
  level        TEXT NOT NULL,
  opened_at    TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL,
  last_seen_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL,
  last_sent_at TIMESTAMPTZ,
  cleared_at   TIMESTAMPTZ,
  peak         DOUBLE PRECISION,
  rooms        TEXT[] NOT NULL DEFAULT '{}',
  places       TEXT[] NOT NULL DEFAULT '{}',
  ever_sent    BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT FALSE,
  action_id    TEXT
);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS events_open ON events (issue) WHERE cleared_at IS NULL;
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS event_messages (
  id        BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  ts        TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT now(),
  event_id  BIGINT NOT NULL REFERENCES events(id),
  reason    TEXT NOT NULL CHECK (reason IN ('open','escalate','clear')),
  sent      BOOLEAN NOT NULL,
  held      TEXT,
  mode      TEXT NOT NULL,
  text      TEXT
);
ALTER TABLE alerts  ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS event_id BIGINT REFERENCES events(id);
ALTER TABLE actions ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS event_id BIGINT REFERENCES events(id);
-- `dismissed`: "Doesn't fit" (SPEC_alerts §7). Like `decided`, it moves nothing in rho's alert-level funnel.
ALTER TABLE actions DROP CONSTRAINT IF EXISTS actions_stage_check;
ALTER TABLE actions ADD CONSTRAINT actions_stage_check
  CHECK (stage IN ('acknowledged','acted','measured','settings','decided','dismissed'));
GRANT SELECT ON events, event_messages TO planetai_ro;
```

- [ ] **Step 4: Settings**

In `app/settings.py` `RUNTIME`, in the `alerts` group after `QUIET_TO`:

```python
    "ALERT_ENGINE":       ("alerts", "Alert engine", False, False,
                           "rules = every rule sends on its own, as before (default). shadow = the event engine "
                           "(docs/SPEC_alerts.md) decides what it would send and records it, and sends nothing; "
                           "the rules keep sending. events = the event engine sends instead of the rules."),
    "ALERT_MAX_PER_DAY":  ("alerts", "Most messages a day", False, False,
                           "With the event engine: pushes a day outside danger, default 4. Beyond it an event "
                           "is still recorded and waits for the next report. Danger is never held."),
    "HOME_HAS":           ("alerts", "What this home has", False, False,
                           "Comma-separated: purifier, ac, fan, windows (windows that open). The event engine "
                           "only suggests what is here to use."),
```

In `CHOICES`:

```python
    "ALERT_ENGINE":  ("rules", "shadow", "events"),
```

(`ALERT_MAX_PER_DAY` is a number and `HOME_HAS` a list: validate both in `events_pg`, not in `CHOICES`.)

In `.env.example`, after `QUIET_TO=6`:

```
# rules (default) | shadow | events. docs/SPEC_alerts.md: shadow records what the event engine would send, sends nothing.
ALERT_ENGINE=rules
# With the event engine: pushes a day outside danger.
ALERT_MAX_PER_DAY=4
# What this home has, comma-separated: purifier, ac, fan, windows.
HOME_HAS=
```

In `docs/site/configuration.md`, add three rows to the alerts table in the same shape as its neighbours (one row
per key above, with default and choices), and in `tools/check_docs.py` remove `"ALERT_ENGINE"` from
`PROPOSED["docs/SPEC_alerts.md"]`.

- [ ] **Step 5: Write `app/events_pg.py`**

```python

The `text` column is filled by Task 4.

- [ ] **Step 6: Wire `run_rules`**

In `app/main.py` `run_rules`, read the mode once before the loop, skip kinded rules on the old path, collect their
candidates, and run the engine after the loop:

```python
def run_rules() -> None:
    rules = packs.load_rules()
    mode = settings.get("ALERT_ENGINE", "rules") or "rules"
    cands = []
    with db() as con, con.cursor() as cur:
        try:
            run_report(cur)
        except Exception as e:  # noqa: BLE001
            log.warning("report failed: %s", e)
        for rule in rules:
            if rule.get("kind") and mode == "rules":
                continue                  # kinded rules belong to the event engine (docs/SPEC_alerts.md)
            try:
                rows = index.run_ro(cur, rule["sql"])
            except Exception as e:  # noqa: BLE001
                log.warning("rule %s failed: %s", rule.get("id"), e)
                continue
            if rule.get("kind"):
                cands += events_pg.candidates(rule, rows)
                continue                  # never through the old cooldown-and-send path
            ...  # the existing per-row body, unchanged, except: in mode "events" it does not call notify()
        if mode in ("shadow", "events"):
            try:
                events_pg.run(cur, cands, mode, _local_now())
            except Exception as e:  # noqa: BLE001
                log.warning("event engine failed: %s", e)
```

Kinded rules write no `alerts` row in this plan, on purpose. An act-level `alerts` row is an open ask on the
dashboard and a row in ρ's denominator, so writing them in shadow would change what the household sees and what ρ
says, which shadow must never do. Recording kinded rows in `alerts` and linking them through `alerts.event_id`
belongs to Plan 2, together with `events` mode actually sending; the column is created here so Plan 2 adds no
schema step.

Keep the existing per-row body exactly as it is (cooldown, insert into `alerts`, `ha_alert`), and change only its
`send` line to `send = mode != "events" and floor.get(...) >= ... and not _quiet(level)`. Add `import events_pg`
beside the other app imports. In `events` mode nothing notifies yet: Plan 2 wires the event messages to Telegram,
so `events` must not be set on a node until then — say so in the `ALERT_ENGINE` help text by appending
" Until the release that adds buttons, events records and sends nothing: use shadow."

- [ ] **Step 7: Run tests and prove the schema twice**

Run: `PYTHONPATH=app python3 tests/test_events_pg.py` — expected three lines, last `events_pg: …`.
Run against a scratch Postgres: `psql "$SCRATCH_DB" -f init.sql` twice, then
`psql "$SCRATCH_DB" -c "\d events" -c "\d event_messages"` — expected both tables, no errors.

Register `test_events_pg|PYTHONPATH=app python3 tests/test_events_pg.py` in `tests/all`, count 57 → 58.

- [ ] **Step 8: Lint, test, commit**

Run: `make lint && make test` — expected `ok` and `58 suites: 58 passed`.

```bash
git add init.sql app/events_pg.py app/main.py app/settings.py .env.example docs/site/configuration.md tools/check_docs.py tests/test_events_pg.py tests/all
git commit -m "events: the Postgres store, ALERT_ENGINE (rules|shadow|events), and the engine in run_rules"
```

PR body note: "`init.sql` changes: two maintainers (GOVERNANCE.md)."

### Task 4: Messages and actions chosen from the context

**Files:**
- Create: `app/actions.py`
- Modify: `app/issues/heat.yml`, `app/issues/air.yml` (append `events:` and `actions:`)
- Modify: `app/events_pg.py` (`context(cur, e)`, fill `event_messages.text` and `events.action_id`)
- Create: `tests/test_actions.py`; `tests/all` (58 → 59)

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `events.Event`, `events.Message`; `events_pg.home_has()`.
- Produces:
  - `actions.holds(when: dict, ctx: dict) -> bool`
  - `actions.choose(actions: list[dict], ctx: dict) -> dict | None` — first action whose `when:` holds
  - `actions.render(issue: dict, msg: events.Message, ctx: dict, locale: str) -> tuple[str, str | None]` — the text
    and the chosen action id
  - context keys (all optional, `None` when unknown): `inside_temp`, `outside_temp`, `inside_pm25`, `outside_pm25`,
    `outside_source`, `hour`, `home_has` (set), `where` (set of `inside`/`outside`), `kind`, `rooms`, `peak`

The `when:` vocabulary is closed (evaluated in Python, never `eval`):

| key | holds when |
|---|---|
| `kind: [sustained, danger]` | the event's kind is listed |
| `where: inside` | `inside` is among the event's places |
| `outside_cooler_by: 2` | `inside_temp - outside_temp >= 2` |
| `outside_hotter: true` | `outside_temp > inside_temp` |
| `outside_pm25_below: 15` | `outside_pm25 < 15` |
| `outside_worse: true` | `outside_pm25 > inside_pm25` |
| `home_has: ac` | `ac` is in `home_has` |
| `hour_from: 17` / `hour_to: 8` | the local hour is in [from, to), wrapping midnight |

A key whose context value is `None` does not hold.

- [ ] **Step 5: Context from the database, and the text recorded**

In `app/events_pg.py` add:

```python
import actions as A
import issues

CTX_SQL = """
SELECT
  (SELECT avg(mean_15m) FROM stats WHERE local AND indoor AND metric = 'temp' AND name = ANY(%(rooms)s)) AS inside_temp,
  (SELECT avg(mean_15m) FROM stats WHERE local AND indoor AND metric = 'pm25' AND name = ANY(%(rooms)s)) AS inside_pm25,
  coalesce((SELECT avg(mean_1h) FROM stats WHERE local AND NOT indoor AND metric = 'temp'),
           (SELECT value FROM observations WHERE sensor_id = 'om-point' AND metric = 'temp_model' AND ts <= now())) AS outside_temp,
  (SELECT avg(mean_1h) FROM stats WHERE local AND NOT indoor AND metric = 'pm25') AS outside_pm25,
  CASE WHEN EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM stats WHERE local AND NOT indoor AND metric = 'temp')
       THEN 'outside' ELSE 'the forecast model' END AS outside_source
"""


def context(cur, e, now) -> dict:
    cur.execute(CTX_SQL, {"rooms": sorted(e.rooms)})
    ctx = dict(cur.fetchone())
    for k in ("inside_temp", "inside_pm25", "outside_temp", "outside_pm25"):
        if ctx[k] is not None:
            ctx[k] = round(float(ctx[k]), 1)
    ctx.update(hour=now.hour, home_has=home_has(), where=set(e.where), kind=e.kind)
    return ctx
```

and in `run()` replace the `INSERT` loop with:

```python
    decl = issues.load()
    for m in msgs:
        text, aid = None, None
        if m.event.issue in decl:
            text, aid = A.render(decl[m.event.issue], m, context(cur, m.event, now), settings.get("ALERT_LOCALE", "en") or "en")
        if aid:
            m.event.action_id = aid
            cur.execute("UPDATE events SET action_id = %s WHERE id = %s", (aid, m.event.id))
        cur.execute("INSERT INTO event_messages (ts, event_id, reason, sent, held, mode, text) VALUES (%s,%s,%s,%s,%s,%s,%s)",
                    (now, m.event.id, m.reason, m.send, m.held, mode, text))
```

Check `issues.load()`'s return shape against `app/issues/__init__.py:689` (a dict keyed by file stem: `heat`, `air`)
before relying on it; `om-point`'s temperature metric name is `temp_model` on node #1 — confirm in
`app/bootstrap.py` and use the name it writes.

- [ ] **Step 6: Run the tests**

Run: `PYTHONPATH=app python3 tests/test_actions.py` — expected four lines, last `actions: …`.
Run: `PYTHONPATH=app python3 tests/test_issues.py && PYTHONPATH=app python3 tests/test_issues_schema.py` — expected
pass: the new top-level keys must not break the issue contract. If `test_issues_schema` lists allowed keys, add
`events` and `actions` there with one comment line naming this spec.

- [ ] **Step 7: Register, lint, test, commit**

`tests/all`: `test_actions|PYTHONPATH=app python3 tests/test_actions.py`, count 58 → 59.
Run: `make lint && make test` — `59 suites: 59 passed`.

```bash
git add app/actions.py app/events_pg.py app/issues/heat.yml app/issues/air.yml tests/test_actions.py tests/all
git commit -m "events: one action per event, chosen from inside, outside, the hour and what the home has"
```

### Task 5: Kinded heat and air rules

**Files:**
- Modify: `packs/heat/rules.yml`, `packs/air-quality/rules.yml` (append rules; touch nothing existing)
- Create: `tests/test_kinded_rules.py`; `tests/all` (59 → 60)

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `recent_15m`, `usual_by_hour` (Task 1); `trustdb.Node` (Task 1).
- Produces rules (every row: `sensor_id, name, value, line, over`, air rows also `where`):
  - `heat/heat_unusual` — `kind: unusual`, `level: act`
  - `heat/heat_sustained` — `kind: sustained`, `level: act`
  - `heat/heat_extreme` — `kind: danger`, `level: act`
  - `air-quality/air_spike` — `kind: spike`, `level: warn`
  - `air-quality/air_unusual` — `kind: unusual`, `level: act`
  - `air-quality/air_sustained` — `kind: sustained`, `level: act`

- [ ] **Step 5: Run the test, then the rule lint**

Run: `PYTHONPATH=tests:app python3 tests/test_kinded_rules.py` — expected three lines, last `kinded rules: …`.
If DuckDB rejects `bool_and`, `greatest` or `"where"` quoting, fix the SQL so both engines accept it (both support
all three; a rejection means a typo).
Run: `python3 tools/check_rules.py` — expected the count line with 7 more rules and cells than before. A
placeholder error means a `message` names a column the SQL does not return: fix the message.

- [ ] **Step 6: The old engine must not run them**

Run: `grep -n 'rule.get("kind")' app/main.py` — expected the two lines from Task 3, Step 6. With
`ALERT_ENGINE=rules` the kinded rules are skipped before their SQL runs.

- [ ] **Step 7: Register, lint, test, commit**

`tests/all`: `test_kinded_rules|PYTHONPATH=tests:app python3 tests/test_kinded_rules.py`, add it to
`EXPECTED_SKIPS`, count 59 → 60.
Run: `make lint && make test` — `60 suites: 60 passed`.

```bash
git add packs/heat/rules.yml packs/air-quality/rules.yml tests/test_kinded_rules.py tests/all
git commit -m "heat, air-quality: kinded rules for the event engine — unusual, sustained, spike, danger"
```

### Task 6: The replay — today's engine against the event engine, over node #1's month

**Files:**
- Create: `tools/replay_alerts.py`
- Modify: `tools/check_docs.py` (remove `tools/replay_alerts.py` from `PROPOSED["docs/SPEC_alerts.md"]`, and the
  entry itself if it is then empty)
- Test: `tests/test_replay.py` (new; small synthetic month, no node data); `tests/all` (60 → 61)

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `trustdb.Node` (Task 1), `events.step`/`MemoryStore`/`Policy` (Task 2), `events_pg.candidates`
  (Task 3), `actions.render` (Task 4), the kinded rules (Task 5).
- Produces: `replay_alerts.replay(node, rules_old, rules_new, start, end, step_min, policy, alert_level) -> dict`
  with keys `old` and `new`, each `{"pushes": [(ts, rule_or_issue, text)], "per_day": {date: n}, "night": n}`;
  CLI `python3 tools/replay_alerts.py --data DIR [--days 30] [--step 5]` printing the comparison table of
  `docs/SPEC_alerts.md` §9 and writing `DIR/old.txt` and `DIR/new.txt`, one message per block.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing test**

`tests/test_replay.py`:

```python
"""tools/replay_alerts.py on a synthetic two days: the old engine repeats on its cooldown, the event engine sends
one story. Needs duckdb. Run: PYTHONPATH=tests:app:tools python3 tests/test_replay.py
"""
import datetime as dt
import sys

try:
    import trustdb as T
    import replay_alerts as R
except ImportError as e:
    print(f"  skipped: {e}")
    sys.exit(0)

import events as E

# two days of node #1's real readings, replayed on the calendar the rules need
rows = T.week(T.readings(), T.FIXTURE_NOW, days=16)
node = T.Node(rows)
end = T.FIXTURE_NOW
res = R.replay(node, R.old_rules(), R.new_rules(), start=end - dt.timedelta(days=2), end=end, step_min=15,
               policy=E.Policy(quiet=(22, 6), max_per_day=4, alert_level="warn"), alert_level="warn")
old, new = res["old"], res["new"]
assert old["pushes"], "the old engine sends something on node #1's days"
assert len(new["pushes"]) < len(old["pushes"]), (len(new["pushes"]), len(old["pushes"]))
night = [text for ts, _, text in new["pushes"] if ts.hour < 6 or ts.hour >= 22]
assert all("DANGER" in text for text in night), f"only danger is sent at night: {night}"
print(f"replay: old {len(old['pushes'])} pushes, new {len(new['pushes'])} over two replayed days")
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Run it to verify it fails**

Run: `PYTHONPATH=tests:app:tools python3 tests/test_replay.py`
Expected: FAIL with `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'replay_alerts'`.

- [ ] **Step 3: Write `tools/replay_alerts.py`**

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""Replay node #1's month through today's rules and through the event engine (docs/SPEC_alerts.md §9).

    tools/fetch_replay.sh /tmp/replay           # read-only, from node #1; household data, never committed
    python3 tools/replay_alerts.py --data /tmp/replay [--days 30] [--step 5]

Rules run in DuckDB exactly as they ship, with now() set to the replayed instant (tests/trustdb.py). The old
engine is app/main.py's run_rules semantics: cooldown per rule and sensor, ALERT_LEVEL, quiet hours holding all
but act. The new engine is app/events.py itself. Prints the §9 table and writes old.txt and new.txt.
Needs duckdb (dev only).

```

- [ ] **Step 4: Run the test**

Run: `PYTHONPATH=tests:app:tools python3 tests/test_replay.py`
Expected: one line `replay: old N pushes, new M over two replayed days` with M < N. If the run takes more than a
couple of minutes, raise `step_min` in the test, not the engine's constants.

- [ ] **Step 5: Register, lint, test, commit**

`tests/all`: `test_replay|PYTHONPATH=tests:app:tools python3 tests/test_replay.py`, in `EXPECTED_SKIPS`, count
60 → 61. Remove the replay tool (and the then-empty entry) from `PROPOSED` in `tools/check_docs.py`.
Run: `make lint && make test` — `61 suites: 61 passed`.

```bash
git add tools/replay_alerts.py tests/trustdb.py tests/test_replay.py tests/all tools/check_docs.py
git commit -m "replay: today's rules against the event engine, on the same readings, side by side"

### Task 7: Fetch node #1's month, run the replay, report

**Files:**
- Create: `tools/fetch_replay.sh`
- Create (not committed): `$SCRATCH/replay/{readings,sensors}.tsv`, `old.txt`, `new.txt`
- Create: `docs/plans/2026-10-04-alert-events-replay.md` — the report Tomas reads (numbers only, no household text
  beyond the message templates)

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `tools/replay_alerts.py` (Task 6).
- Produces: the §9 table filled with node #1's numbers, and a go/no-go for shadow mode.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the fetch script**

`tools/fetch_replay.sh`:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Node #1's last 31 days, read-only, for tools/replay_alerts.py. Household data: write it outside the repository.
#   tools/fetch_replay.sh /some/scratch/dir
# Every query runs in a read-only transaction. Nothing on the node is written, restarted or imported.
set -euo pipefail
out="${1:?usage: tools/fetch_replay.sh DIR}"; mkdir -p "$out"
remote='export PATH="/opt/homebrew/bin:/usr/local/bin:$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH";
  docker exec -i planetai-db-1 psql -U planetai -d planetai -At -v ON_ERROR_STOP=1'
q() { ssh mini "$remote" <<SQL
SET default_transaction_read_only = on;
SET TimeZone = 'Asia/Makassar';
\copy ($1) TO STDOUT
SQL
}
q "SELECT r.ts, r.sensor_id, r.metric, r.value FROM readings r JOIN sensors s USING (sensor_id)
   WHERE r.ts > now() - interval '31 days' AND s.kind = 'sensor' AND r.metric IN ('temp','humidity','pm25')
   ORDER BY r.ts" > "$out/readings.tsv"
q "SELECT sensor_id, source, name, coalesce(lat,0), coalesce(lon,0), indoor, local, kind FROM sensors WHERE kind = 'sensor'" \
  > "$out/sensors.tsv"
wc -l "$out"/*.tsv
```

`chmod +x tools/fetch_replay.sh`. The `\copy … TO STDOUT` output is tab-separated with `t`/`f` booleans, which is
what `trustdb.readings_from` and `sensors_from` read. If `psql -U planetai` fails, read the user name from
`ssh mini 'docker exec planetai-db-1 printenv POSTGRES_USER'` — never print a password.

- [ ] **Step 2: Fetch and replay**

Run:
```bash
S=/private/tmp/replay-$(date +%Y%m%d)
tools/fetch_replay.sh "$S"
python3 tools/replay_alerts.py --data "$S" --days 30 --step 5
```
Expected: two lines, `old` and `new`, and the two message files. The `old` line should be near what node #1 really
sent (~13 a day, 23 at night): if it is far off, the replay is wrong — find why before reading `new`.

- [ ] **Step 3: Write the report and stop**

`docs/plans/2026-10-04-alert-events-replay.md`: the §9 table with both columns filled, the targets met and missed,
ten message pairs (an old burst and the new message for the same hour), and which starting values the numbers say
to change. Commit it with `tools/fetch_replay.sh`:

```bash
git add tools/fetch_replay.sh docs/plans/2026-10-04-alert-events-replay.md
git commit -m "replay: node #1's month through both engines — the numbers for the shadow decision"
```

Then stop and hand the report to Tomas. A missed target changes a rule, a constant in `app/events.py`, or an action
— re-run the replay after each change, never the target. Shadow mode on node #1 (`ALERT_ENGINE=shadow`, a setting
on his node) waits for his go.
