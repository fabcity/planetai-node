# Handoff: the release signing key

Since v0.60 a node refuses an update it cannot attribute. The key that makes that work does not exist
yet, and this session could not make it: a private key that an agent generated is a private key that
was in a transcript. This is the half only you can do, and until it is done every signed release path
refuses — which is the safe direction, and why nothing is blocked by the order of these steps.

## 1. Make the key

On your own machine, once:

```bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -f ~/.planetai/release_key -C release@planetai.fab.city
```

Give it a passphrase. `tools/release.sh` reads the key through `ssh-agent`, so `ssh-add
~/.planetai/release_key` once per session is the whole cost of having one.

## 2. Publish the public half

```bash
printf 'release@planetai.fab.city %s release@planetai.fab.city\n' \
  "$(ssh-keygen -y -f ~/.planetai/release_key | awk '{print $1" "$2}')"
```

That one line replaces the `PLACEHOLDER-NO-RELEASE-KEY-HAS-BEEN-ISSUED-YET` line in **four** files.
They must end up byte-identical; `tests/test_release_consistency.sh` fails if they do not.

| file | why it has its own copy |
|---|---|
| `tools/allowed_signers` | the one a release is signed and verified against |
| `install` | runs before there is a node; cannot read a file out of the tarball it is checking |
| `update.sh` | same, and it is the file that refuses a bad update |
| `bin/planetai` | so `planetai version` can say what the node trusts |

Then put the fingerprint — `ssh-keygen -lf ~/.planetai/release_key.pub | awk '{print $2}'` — into
`SECURITY.md`, where the `SHA256:…` line still says *not yet issued*. Commit all five together.

## 3. Where the key lives

- **The Foundation's password manager.** The private key file and its passphrase, as two separate
  entries. This is the copy that survives a laptop.
- **One working copy** at `~/.planetai/release_key` on the machine that cuts releases, and nowhere else.

Not in this repository (`tools/release.sh` refuses a key whose directory is inside it), not in the
tarball, not in CI, not in a log. CI signs with a throwaway key it generates per run and never sees this
one — if a job ever needs the real key, something has been designed wrong.

## 4. Cutting a release

```bash
ssh-add ~/.planetai/release_key
PLANETAI_SIGNING_KEY=~/.planetai/release_key tools/release.sh 0.60
```

It refuses before it tags if the key is missing, is inside the repository, or is not the key
`tools/allowed_signers` publishes — that last one is the quiet failure, where everything signs happily
and every node then refuses.

`PLANETAI_UNSIGNED=1` builds a tarball nobody signed, for a test you will throw away. It says so in red
at both ends.

## 5. Rotation

Two releases, never one.

1. **Add** the new public line to `tools/allowed_signers` and the three embedded copies, *beside* the
   old one, both with the principal `release@planetai.fab.city`. Ship a release signed with the **old**
   key. Every node now accepts either.
2. Wait until nodes have taken that release — `planetai doctor` shows the row, and the fleet is small
   enough to ask. Then ship a release signed with the **new** key.
3. **Remove** the old line in the release after that.

A node only ever learns a new key by installing an update signed with a key it already trusts, so the
order matters: remove the old line too early and any node that has not updated yet is stranded on a key
nothing signs with. There is no recovery from that over the network — it is a person, at the machine.

If the key is believed lost or copied, that patience is not available: publish the new line, ship, and
say so in `SECURITY.md` and the changelog. A node that has not updated will refuse the new release and
have to be reinstalled by hand. Two copies in two places is what stops this being likely.

## 6. Cloudflare is now a mirror, not the source

`planetai.fab.city/node0/get` is one bucket with one writer and no history a reader can check. It is
still where nodes fetch from by default, but it is no longer what they trust: the signature is. Every
release also goes to a GitHub Release, with the same bytes and the same signature, and a node reads
that instead with one variable:

```bash
PLANETAI_GET=https://github.com/fabcity/planetai-node/releases/download/v0.60 \
  bash -c "$(curl -fsSL planetai.fab.city/install)"
```

So a compromised bucket is now a detectable event rather than a silent one, and there is somewhere else
to send a tester while it is sorted out.
