# Handoff — the earth pack (AlphaEarth)

What shipped in v0.33, what was measured, what was decided and why, and what still needs Tomas. Scope was
E.1 + E.2 + E.4 of `claude/PLANETAI_AlphaEarth_Integration_Plan.md` (6 Sep), then E.3 and the E.5 framing in
the v0.33.1 round. E.6 and E.7 were not started.

## Tracker rows for `claude/PLANETAI_Next_Steps_Tracker.md`

| row | was | now |
|---|---|---|
| E.1 the pack | planned | **done** — `packs/earth/`, one `partial` cell, `GET /earth`, one dashboard card, rehearsed on the Lima node |
| E.2 the Kuta Selatan exhibit | planned | **done** — `out/earth/exhibit_kuta_selatan_2023_2025.html`, built from node #1's own coordinates and its published air record |
| E.3 the NAS mirror of `out/earth/` | planned | **done** — `tools/nas/pull.py` archives the results, not the cache |
| E.4 the observatory card | planned | **done, not deployed** — two commits in `fabcity/planetai`, `make check` green |
| E.5 the academic sample application, 15 Oct | planned | **framed** — Tomas decided 6 Sep to claim the method, not a result. Material below; the text is still to write |
| E.6 | planned | not started |
| E.7 | planned | not started |

## What was measured

Every number below was produced by running the thing, at node #1's coordinates (−8.8271, 115.15709) unless
it says otherwise. Nothing here is extrapolated from the plan's arithmetic.

| | measured |
|---|---|
| anonymous read of `gs://alphaearth_foundations` | works. Listing, HEAD and ranged GET, no credentials, no billing project, about 1.5 GB pulled during this work at no charge to any project of ours |
| the file | 8192×8192 px, 64 bands, `int8`, nodata −128, tiled 1024×1024, **planar-separate**, **zstd**, overviews 2…8192. Exactly what the bucket's README claims |
| de-quantised unit norm | 20,000 real pixels: mean 1.000093, min 0.99242, max 1.00847, σ 0.00203. Every one inside 1e-2. On the raw integers the norms are ≈ 321 |
| tile index | 26 range reads, 189 kB, 30 s to binary-search `aef_index.csv` by UTM zone, then one block: 8.8 MB for 50S, 9.1 MB in the shipped run. 3,351 rows, one tile per year covers the point |
| one AOI-year, 10 km square | **64,000,128 bytes on disk**, **~103 MB over the wire**, **149 s** cold on the laptop (71–184 s under contention) |
| nine years | 576 MB kept, 925 MB pulled, ~22 minutes |
| Bali, three years | 2023, 2024, 2025 in 359 s, 192 MB |
| Santiago (`pai-clean`), two years | 2024, 2025 in 215 s, 128 MB, UTM 19S |
| image growth on `planetai packs install` | **458 MB → 710 MB (+252 MB)**, 8 min 56 s to rebuild on the arm64 Lima node |
| `libexpat1` | 436 kB installed |
| change, Bali 2024→2025 | mean 0.0414, median 0.0393, p95 0.0926, max 0.4286; 1.19 % over 0.15 = 119 ha |
| change, Bali 2023→2025 | mean 0.0650, median 0.0618, p95 0.1490, max 0.6274; 4.92 % over 0.15 = 492 ha |
| change, Santiago 2024→2025 | mean 0.0151, median 0.0128, p95 0.0317; 0.10 % over 0.15 = 10 ha |
| the card | 375 / 768 / 1440 px: contributes no horizontal overflow at any width, the pill stays visible, the 1000 px image renders at 297 / 657 / 643 px inside its card, always inside the card's right edge, the row collapses to one column under 900 px |
| `similar`, four pilots | 39–47 s each, most of it the index lookup. Best in-tile match: Bali 0.986 at 7.8 km, Santiago 0.994 at 7.2 km, Boston 0.972 at 5.2 km, Barcelona 0.942 at 5.6 km |
| between pilots, 2025 | Barcelona↔Boston **0.744**, Bali↔Barcelona 0.501, Bali↔Santiago 0.455, Bali↔Boston 0.430, Barcelona↔Santiago 0.410, Boston↔Santiago 0.391 |

## Decisions, and why

**A centred window, not one aligned to the file's blocks.** The COGs are tiled 1024×1024 internally, so a
1000 px window centred on the node straddles four blocks and GDAL pulls all four: 103 MB to keep 64 MB.
Snapping the window to a single block would cost 14.5 MB, a sevenfold saving, but for node #1 it would put the
node 2.1 km from one edge of its own square and 8.1 km from the other. The product is "the land around here",
so the node stays in the middle and the bandwidth is stated instead of hidden. `EARTH_RADIUS_M` is the knob.

**Band by band, not one `ds.read()`.** Reading all 64 bands in one call took nine minutes; one band at a time
takes 149 s. GDAL's default block cache is smaller than the 256 MB a 64-band window touches, so blocks were
fetched, evicted and fetched again. `GDAL_ENV` in `adapter.py` also raises the vsicurl range chunk from 16 kB
to 256 kB, roughly one internal block, which cut the request count by an order of magnitude.

**Binary-search the CSV index.** There is no GeoJSON index; the forms are GeoParquet (70 MB), GeoPackage
(539 MB) and CSV (798 MB), and `pyarrow` was not approved. The CSV is sorted by UTM zone (1N…60N, then
1S…60S) with years interleaved inside each zone, so ~21 range reads find the zone's block and one read
fetches it. Stdlib `urllib` and `csv` only. The resolved tiles are cached in `meta.json`, so this happens
once per node. If Google ever regenerates the file in a different order the search degrades safely: the
caller filters the returned rows by zone and `resolve()` raises if none match.

**The threshold is 0.15, and it is the only chosen number in the pack.** Reasoning and the calibration
evidence are in `packs/earth/README.md`. Short version: at node #1 it sits at about the 99th percentile of a
consecutive-year comparison, so a normal year flags ~1 % of the square; Santiago, a mature city, flags 0.1 %.
At 0.05 — the threshold the `earth-engine` pack uses on a different quantity — a third of the Bali square is
"changed" every year.

**`Environmental|City`, `partial`, forever.** The node does the arithmetic, but the input is a Google model's
description of a place that nobody here can check against anything. `live` means measured here.

**No `rules.yml` in v0.** `earth-engine` already fires `land_changed`. A second alert for the same event is
the duplication below, not a feature.

**The attribution wording.** The prompt asked for `Satellite Embedding dataset © Google and Google DeepMind,
CC BY 4.0`. The dataset's licence asks for a specific sentence: "The AlphaEarth Foundations Satellite
Embedding dataset is produced by Google and Google DeepMind." The licence's wording ships, plus CC BY 4.0, so
the requirement is actually met. It appears in `pack.yaml`, the README, `GET /earth`, the dashboard card, the
exhibit, the observatory panel, the sensor's `meta`, and inside the PNG as a `tEXt` chunk.

## Resolved in v0.33.1: two numbers for one thing, and no alert for either

`earth-engine` published `land_change_score` — 1 − cosine of the **mean** embedding vector over 1 km, inside
Earth Engine, behind a service-account key — while the earth pack publishes the mean of the **per-pixel**
distances over 10 km, computed on the node from a public bucket. Different quantities, no agreement (0.037
against 0.041 on node #1), both `partial`, both described in words as "the land changed". Tomas chose to
retire the Earth Engine one. Done: the embedding dataset and its block are out of
`packs/earth-engine/adapter.py`, `land_change_score` is out of its `metrics:`, its second
`Environmental|Bioregion` cell is deleted, and that pack's `rules.yml` is gone. It keeps Dynamic World,
Sentinel-2 and VIIRS — what only Earth Engine can give.

**The alert did not move with it, and that was a measurement, not a preference.** The plan was to repoint
`land_changed` at `earth-point` / `land_change_yoy`. Then four pilot squares were measured for 2024→2025:

| place | mean | over 0.15 |
|---|---|---|
| Kuta Selatan, Bali | 0.0414 | 1.19 % |
| Boston | 0.0404 | 3.26 % |
| Barcelona | 0.0164 | 0.15 % |
| Santiago | 0.0151 | 0.10 % |

Boston and Barcelona sit at the same latitude and differ by two and a half times. Boston's change is spread
across built-up land — its harbour is one of the quietest parts of its own map, so this is not water — which
makes snow and deciduous leaf-off between two annual composites a far likelier explanation than 326 hectares
of Boston being rebuilt in a year. That last part is a guess; nothing here separates a season from a
bulldozer. Any threshold that fires in Kuta Selatan, where the land really is being built on, also fires in
Boston every year for nothing, and `AGENTS.md` says not to add alerts a household would ignore. So the pack
ships no rules file, `tests/test_shipped.py` pins that it must not, and the README carries the table and the
reason. A tester who ran `earth-engine` with a key loses a message they had; that is the cost of not having
one we can defend.

**What would make the alert possible.** Either a per-node baseline — fire when this year sits well above this
node's own previous years, which needs four or five cached years and a constant chosen with better evidence
than four squares of one year-pair — or something that separates phenology from structure. The dataset's 64
channels may carry that; nobody here has looked.

## E.3, done: the results, not the cache

`tools/nas/pull.py` now archives every `change_*.json` and its map from `/earth`, alongside the dumps and
exports it already pulls. Not the `.npy` embedding cache: 64 MB a year, and `planetai run earth fetch` remakes
any of it in about two and a half minutes from a public bucket Google has committed to keep publishing. What
cannot be remade once a node is gone is the record of what that node computed and when, and that is a few
hundred kB a pair.

Two small things had to exist first. `GET /earth` returns `changes`, every comparison the node computed rather
than only the latest, each with a `png_url`; and `GET /earth/change.png?pair=2023_2025` serves any of them.
The pair only selects among comparisons that exist — the file name still comes from the pack's own JSON, never
the request, and a malformed pair is rejected by the route's pattern before any file logic runs. Verified:
`?pair=../../etc/passwd` returns 422, an unknown pair 404. Rehearsed against the Lima node: two files pulled,
nothing re-pulled on the second run, and the PNG magic-byte check refuses a JSON body without writing.

## E.4, what the observatory panel does now

One commit in `fabcity/planetai`, `make check` green, **not deployed**. The RQ3 panel was
`MOCK · REAL ARCHITECTURE` with five pre-fetched cities and a "Connect RSFM →" button for a trusted-tester
programme nobody joined. It now reads `observatory/data/alphaearth_similarity.json`, written by
`planetai run earth similar`, and shows the four pilots with their closest in-tile match, the six pairwise
similarities, and one sentence saying the search covers one UTM tile and why it is not global. The pill is
`LIVE · REGIONAL` (`live-pill sm`). Without the file — including when the page is opened from disk, which
blocks the fetch — the pill degrades to `AWAITING DATA` (`partial-pill sm`) and the panel names the command
that writes it, rather than falling back to a made-up result.

Both AlphaEarth connector entries moved off `config`: the embeddings to `ready` (no account needed), Open
Buildings to `testable` (still an Earth Engine key). That raises the page's "connected" headline count by
one, which is correct but worth knowing. The modal template now says what is settled and what is not.

Verified in a browser against a local server: 4 cards of real data, the pill and its class, the scope
sentence, the footer, the modal, both connector cards, and the empty state with the file removed.

## The releases, and the parallel session

`v0.33` is tagged at `fc437f9` and `v0.33.1` at `fd277db`, which is where `origin/main` and this checkout
both stand. The tarball in `../planetai/node0/get/` is v0.33.1, 392 kB, 156 files.

Rehearsed on the Lima node at both versions. v0.32.1 → v0.33: nothing lost (4,633 readings, 13 alerts, 7
actions), the pack appears in `planetai packs`, `planetai run earth verify` exits 0, and the card renders in
all three of its states — absent pack (hidden entirely, height 0), loaded but never fetched (the sentence
naming `planetai run earth fetch` and the measured size), and cached (the map). v0.33 → v0.33.1: nothing lost
(4,659 readings), no rules files in either pack, no rule failures in the log, one land-change cell instead of
two, `/earth` lists its comparisons, `?pair=` serves them, and `verify` exits 0 again.

**A design audit ran in parallel, in this same checkout.** It moved the working tree twice: onto
`audit/design-2026-09` after the pack commit, so three of this work's commits landed there before `main` was
fast-forwarded to them; and then, after v0.33 shipped, onto `audit/design-2026-09-report` branched from
*before* this work's last commit, where it committed 209 screenshot files. The second move silently reverted
the handoff on disk and would have mixed the v0.33.1 release into the audit branch, so v0.33.1 was built in a
separate `git worktree` at `origin/main` and the shared checkout was left untouched until Tomas confirmed the
audit was read-only work.

Resolved: `main` carries this work, the checkout is back on `main` at `fd277db`, and nothing of this work
sits on an audit branch that is not also on `main`. The two audit branches are left alone —
`audit/design-2026-09` is now an ancestor of `main`, and `audit/design-2026-09-report` still holds the 209
audit files, which exist nowhere else.

The lesson is cheap and worth keeping: **one working tree per agent.** `git worktree add` costs nothing and
makes two agents in one repository safe. Sharing a checkout cost about forty minutes here and came close to
losing a commit that had already been pushed.

## Also found, not fixed

- **The site had no JavaScript parse gate — fixed in v0.33.1.** An apostrophe inside a single-quoted string
  in the connectors list (`tab's`) broke the whole 11,000-line inline script, so the panel's render function
  was undefined and the panel came up empty, while `make check` said ok. The site's `scripts/check_html.py`
  now runs every inline script through node's parser, and the deploy workflow runs `make check` instead of
  its own copy of the tag parser, which had already drifted. Broken on purpose four ways first — the
  apostrophe, an unclosed brace, an unterminated template literal and a stray `</div>` — and each was
  caught.
- **A 54 px horizontal overflow on the dashboard at 375 px**, from `.bighex` in `app/static/index.html`. It
  is there with the earth card hidden, so it predates this work. Left alone deliberately.
- **`packs/air-quality/cells.yml:25` already publishes `Environmental|City`** (PM2.5, public reference
  stations). Two cells under one key is how the node already works — `Environmental|Bioregion` carries three
  — and `/cells` lists both with their own units. Worth a decision eventually about which cell a consumer
  should read.
- **The observatory still has a button calling `openModal('alphaearth_buildings')`,** a key that does not
  exist, so it opens "Not yet implemented". Line 6325, in the Open Buildings panel. One line. Left alone
  deliberately.
- **The observatory's footer legend and version line** (near lines 9523-9524) describe the page's provenance
  states in prose and still name only SYNTHETIC and MOCK. The AlphaEarth panel is now LIVE. The prompt
  limited the edit to the panel, its modal and the connectors entries, so they were left alone.
- **A design audit ran in this same checkout while this work was in progress** — 209 files of dashboard and
  observatory screenshots, from a second session, now committed on its own branch. Not from this work. See
  the branch note above; it is the reason v0.33.1 was built in a separate worktree.

- **Screenshots of the dashboard could not be captured** from the browser pane used here: every capture came
  back as the page's background colour while the DOM measured as fully rendered. The card was verified by
  measurement (widths, overflow, image geometry, visibility) rather than by eye.

## E.5, the academic sample application, 15 Oct — decided: claim the method

Tomas's call on 6 September: the application claims the instrument and the method, not a result. That is the
right call, because there is no result to claim — node #1 began measuring air on 2 September 2026, so the
earliest date a land-against-air claim could rest on a year of local readings is September 2027.

**What can be claimed, with something measured behind each.**

- A small computer in a house can hold and interrogate a planetary-scale foundation-model product on its own
  disk, with no account, no key, no cloud project and no institutional agreement. 64 MB a year for a 10 km
  square, about 103 MB pulled, 150 seconds, from a bucket that answers anonymous range requests. Those are
  measured numbers at four sites, not estimates.
- The arithmetic is reproducible and checked rather than asserted. The de-quantisation is the dataset's own;
  unit length was verified on 20,000 real pixels in Bali and again on 2,000 in Santiago at every run of
  `planetai run earth verify`; the distance bounds, the no-data handling, the window maths and the image
  writer are pinned by offline tests, each of which was broken on purpose and watched to fail.
- It runs unchanged at four pilot sites in four UTM zones and three climates, on an ARM node with 3 GB of
  memory, and one of them is in Indonesia rather than in the lab that wrote it.
- Provenance is enforced by the instrument, not by the author's good intentions. The cell is `partial` and
  the core will not promote it, whatever the number looks like.
- The method surfaced its own confound and the project acted on it. Measuring four squares showed that the
  year-over-year mean cannot separate construction from phenology, so the alert that was planned was not
  shipped. That is the strongest thing in the application: a pipeline that declines to make a claim it
  cannot support, with the evidence written down.

**What must not be claimed.** Any relationship between land structure and local air — the exhibit pairs the
two and says in plain words that they cannot explain each other. Any statement that a particular change *was*
a building or a road; embedding change is unattributed by construction. Comparability of the number between
climates, which is the confound above. Novelty of the dataset itself, which is Google's and is cited as such
everywhere it appears.

**The one result that is available is a negative one**, and it is worth putting in: over four pilot squares
and one year-pair, the mean per-pixel embedding distance does not distinguish a place being built on from a
place with deciduous trees and snow. Kuta Selatan 0.0414 and Boston 0.0404 against Barcelona 0.0164 and
Santiago 0.0151. A reviewer can check it against the same public files.

**What would turn it into a result, and when.** A node with a year of its own readings — September 2027 at
the earliest for node #1 — or a way to separate phenology from structure inside the 64 channels, which nobody
here has attempted.

## The exhibit

Not committed — `out/` is runtime. On this laptop:

- `out/earth/exhibit_kuta_selatan_2023_2025.html` (986 kB, self-contained, the PNG embedded)
- `out/earth/bayu-2/change_2023_2025.png` (733 kB)
- `out/earth/bayu-2/change_2023_2025.json` (1 kB)

It pairs the 2023→2025 change map for node #1's 10 km square with the five days of PM2.5 the node has
actually measured, and the paragraph says in plain words that the two cannot explain each other. Node #1 was
read over the tailnet, read-only, on `GET /health`, `/sensors` and `/aggregates` only; nothing raw moved.
The generator is a one-off script, kept outside the repo because the deliverable list did not include it:
its path is in the session's scratchpad as `make_exhibit.py`. Say the word and it becomes a fifth
script in the pack.

Copy the three files into a tracked directory under docs/ only if you want them in the repo.

## Addendum, 7 September 2026 — moving a node (v0.33.4)

Tomas asked how to regenerate the 1 km plan after editing `NODE_LAT` / `NODE_LON`. There is no stored drawing: the
dashboard builds it from `/place/geojson`, so the answer is `planetai restart`, `planetai run place refresh`, reload
the page. Answering it turned up the same bug in both location packs, and the rehearsal turned up two more instances.

- `place` decided staleness from the radius and the age only, and `place_runs` never recorded its centre. A moved
  node served the previous neighbourhood for up to thirty days while computing distances from the new point.
- `earth` re-resolved its tiles on a move but skipped every cached year as "already cached" (the files are named by
  year), so it kept comparing the previous square, with `meta.json` claiming the new one.
- Then: a partial re-fetch left one year from each square and `change` compared them (same pixel shape, so its only
  check passed). And the old square's `change_*.json` stayed on disk, where `/earth`, the card and the Index cell
  went on reading it.

Both packs now record the point they were read around, treat a move as staleness, and drop what belonged to the
abandoned square. A drift under 1% of the radius (floor 25 m) is not a move. Each pack carries its own copy of that
rule; packs do not import each other.

**Rehearsed on `pai-clean`** (Santiago → Poblenou → 800 m north → back to Santiago): the legacy path refetched and
recorded its point (4,860 Santiago features became 8,803 Poblenou ones); an 11 m correction changed nothing; an
813 m move logged `place: refreshing (the node moved 813 m)`; `earth verify` step 5 failed with
`the cache was read around -33.43107, -70.60454, 11609697 m from this node` while the old step 6 still reported
`10.00 x 10.00 km, asked for 10.00`; `earth fetch 2025` removed 2024 and the stale comparison, then re-read 50 MB.

### Two things to know, neither introduced here

1. **Postgres segfaulted three times on this bench**, on `INSERT INTO readings … ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` (signal 11,
   automatic recovery each time, no data lost), while PostGIS was writing 8,803 geometries from the move. 160,000
   rows pushed through the same statement by hand afterwards produced no crash, and **node #1 has none in 14 hours**
   on the same amd64 image. The difference is the emulator: this VM runs it under `qemu-user-static`, node #1 under
   Colima. Read as a test-bench artifact, not a node finding — but if a tester on x86 or Colima ever reports
   `server closed the connection unexpectedly`, this is the first place to look.
2. **A move plus an unreachable Overpass means a retry every poll** until it lands (Overpass was 504-ing during the
   rehearsal). That is how the age-based path has always behaved; it is not new, and the node keeps serving.
