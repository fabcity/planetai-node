# Handoff: nine directions, and the question

**14 September 2026, extended 15 September (twice).** Phase 1 of the dashboard redesign is done and
this session stops here. Phase 2 builds the one that is picked; it starts from this file, in this
session if Tomas answers, else in a fresh one.

**Nine directions now, in three rounds.**

- **A, B, C** were the first. Tomas leaned to C's logic — the page organised by *where*.
- **D, E, F** answered "put [H3](https://h3geo.org/) in the navigation, not in a picture". All
  three keep C's claim that a household navigates by place and differ in which H3 relation does the
  navigating: the resolution ladder (D), the disk outward (E), or none, with the grid supplying each
  of C's four zones a picture, an address and a scale (F).
- **G, H, I** answer "go more radical, and base *all* the navigation on it". These have no document
  spine at all. G is one cell at a time and the URL is the place. H has one control and it is
  resolution. I is one grid that never moves, with the issue as a layer over it. **In all three the
  four distances leave the navigation** and come back as a word on a reading saying whose it is —
  which is what round two measured them to be.

Branch: `dashboard-redesign-2026-09`, cut from `main` at **v0.53** (`a06655a`). Nothing on the node's
own surface has changed: the commits on it are a measuring script, a Phase 0 reading, the argument
and this. `make lint` and 33/33 after each.

## What to open

The drawings are **served, not opened** — from a `file://` page Chromium refuses the sign sprite and
two of the three faces fall back silently, which makes a drawing judged on type and signs unreadable.

```bash
cd ~/Documents/Claude/Projects/FAB\ CITY/planetai-design/prototypes/dashboard-directions
python3 -m http.server 8090
```

| | | the wall |
|---|---|---|
| **A** the index is the page | http://127.0.0.1:8090/a/ | http://127.0.0.1:8090/a/?view=wall |
| **B** the matrix | http://127.0.0.1:8090/b/ | http://127.0.0.1:8090/b/?view=wall |
| **C** the ground | http://127.0.0.1:8090/c/ | http://127.0.0.1:8090/c/?view=wall |
| **D** the ladder — H3 | http://127.0.0.1:8090/d/ | http://127.0.0.1:8090/d/?view=wall |
| **E** the disk — H3 | http://127.0.0.1:8090/e/ | http://127.0.0.1:8090/e/?view=wall |
| **F** the ground, gridded — H3 | http://127.0.0.1:8090/f/ | http://127.0.0.1:8090/f/?view=wall |
| **G** the address — H3 navigates | http://127.0.0.1:8090/g/ | http://127.0.0.1:8090/g/?view=wall |
| **H** the dial — H3 navigates | http://127.0.0.1:8090/h/ | http://127.0.0.1:8090/h/?view=wall |
| **I** the surface — H3 navigates | http://127.0.0.1:8090/i/ | http://127.0.0.1:8090/i/?view=wall |

Narrow the window for 390. **Open I first, then E's wall.** I is the page the third round is really
arguing for; E's wall is still the one thing a stranger walking past would understand with nothing
explained.

**G, H and I move, so press them.** They are the only three where a screenshot is not the drawing:

| | try this | what it is meant to show |
|---|---|---|
| G | press **in** three times, then a neighbour with no number on it | most cells are empty, and the page has to say so |
| G | `?cell=8495a4dffffffff` | standing above every source this node has |
| H | the dial's **4**, then **11** | the map zooms with the dial; at 4 the 3 km this node has mapped is a smudge inside a 237 km cell |
| H | scroll to **What leaves this house by radio** | a peer is a cell and a rough distance, never a pin |
| H | scroll to **What the satellite says** | four real Sentinel passes, and the 1,874 buildings only the satellite knows |
| H | the base strip on the map: **satellite → street map → plan, offline** | live tiles rescale with the dial; the third sends nothing. From resolution 9 inward the plan is the default (Tomas's rule) — the dial opens at 8 on the tiles; turn it in one stop and the ground is the node's own drawing |
| H | **What the stations read** → press **temperature** | fourteen stations regroup by cell as the dial turns; every source is a link |
| H | `?view=wall` and wait eight seconds | the wall is the grid: nineteen cells with what is read in each, re-filling as the dial turns — at 4 one cell holds everything, at 6 five, from 7 to 10 the same picture |
| H | the **Notes** at the foot | every explanation on the page, folded per section |
| H | `?view=setup` | the sections this node runs, by pack, from the real registry — on · move · **propose back** — drawn, not built |
| H | **The hardware in this house** | the four devices on this ground, and the open-hardware-manager row honestly "not connected" |
| I | the layer switch: **Air → Land → Coast** | four issues, four completely different geometries |
| I | press any cell with a heavy outline | one station's own reading, which `/issues` does not publish today |

Add `?state=empty` for a fresh node and `?state=refused` for a phone with no token. The
wireframes are `?view=network`, `?view=setup`, `?view=arrange`.

Every render is also a JPEG, at one device pixel, in
`planetai-design/prototypes/dashboard-directions/shots/<a…i>/` — `_fold.jpg` is the first screen
and `_full.jpg` the whole page. The shipped page, measured the same way on the same afternoon, is the
baseline in [`docs/design/REDESIGN_2026-09_ground.md`](design/REDESIGN_2026-09_ground.md).

The argument, reader by reader, and every number:
[`docs/design/DIRECTIONS_2026-09.md`](design/DIRECTIONS_2026-09.md).

## The third round, short

| | target | C | E disk | G address | H dial | I surface |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| first screen says everything @ 390 | five of five | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ *in this node's cell* | ✓ | ✓ |
| empty share @ 1440 | ≤ 30 % | 70.5 | 63.7 | 63.7 | 59.6 | **42.2** |
| empty share @ 390 / 768 | ≤ 20 % | 43.2 / 55.3 | 34.9 / 31.9 | 33.9 / 33.9 | 33.7 / 36.3 | **33.2** / 34.5 |
| page @ 1440 / 390, screens | ≤ 4 / ≤ 8 | 3.1 / 5.5 | 3.4 / 4.9 | 4.1 / 5.5 | 5.5 / **8.4** | **2.4 / 3.1** |
| orphan numerals · components | 0 · 0 | 0 · 2 | 0 · 4 | 0 · **0** | 0 · **0** | 0 · **0** |

H's column is the revised page — the map, the radio and the satellite. It has since been rebuilt
again as a **modular shell**: ten sections from six packs, registered against a contract
(`kit-page.js`), ordered by the loop *observe · decide · act · measure*, with a live tile map,
the station list with a variable selector and source links, every explanation folded at the foot,
and a wall whose dial turns by itself. Measured: empty share fell to **48.9 %** at 1440 (from 59.6)
and the page grew to **8.1 screens** at 1440 and **12.6** at 390. The argument for that version is
in the directions document under *H, revised again*; the lever for its length is the contract's own
— a section is a file, and a file can move to the Network view.
| wall on a 1,080 px screen | 1,080 | **1,080** | 1,133 | **1,080** | **1,080** | **1,080** |

**I is the first page in three rounds to move T2 at 1440** — 42.2 % against C's 70.5 — and it does it
with a drawing that is the instrument rather than a decoration behind the text. It is also the
shortest page measured, at 2.4 screens. It still misses the 30 % target, and after nine compositions
that is now a statement about the target.

Five things the third round measured that the first two could not, because nothing in them varied
the grain or put the issues on one ground:

- **Between resolution 7 and resolution 10 nothing changes.** Four stops of the dial, 343 times
  smaller by area, and the same nine cells hold the same fourteen stations. Past res 7, grain is
  precision with no information in it.
- **The satellite square is 374,551 cells at its own 10 m grain and 4,063 after `compactCells`** —
  the same ground exactly, 92 times smaller. The only place in three rounds where H3 does something
  the node could not already do by hand.
- **Six of the seven footprints were already declared** in packs and presets. The one that is not
  belongs to the model point, which covers 4,396 cells where a probe in this room covers 1.
- **Four issues, four geometries** on one 217-cell grid: air 7, heat 7 — and heat's own declared
  footprint is smaller than one cell of it, so 0 — land 15 with no station in any of them, coast all
  217, water none. The shipped page draws all four as bands of equal height.
- **Navigating away from your own cell costs the numeral.** G in an empty cell fails T1's second leg,
  measured. That is the idea's cost, not the drawing's.

## The second round, short

| | target | C | D ladder | E disk | F gridded |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| first screen says everything @ 390 | five of five | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| empty share @ 390 / 768 | ≤ 20 % | 43.2 / 55.3 | 42.8 / 60.2 | **34.9 / 31.9** | 43.7 / 55.8 |
| page @ 1440 / 390, screens | ≤ 4 / ≤ 8 | **3.1** / 5.5 | 4.3 / 5.7 | 3.4 / **4.9** | 5.4 / **8.6** |
| orphan numerals · components | 0 · 0 | 0 · 2 | 0 · **2** | 0 · 4 | 0 · 5 |
| wall on a 1,080 px screen | 1,080 | **1,080** | **1,080** | 1,133 | 1,130 |

**E is the only page in either round to pass T2's 30 % at any width** (31.9 % at 768), and the thing
filling its fold is a drawing that carries readings rather than a decorative map. C and D are the
only two whose wall fits; E's and F's are 53 and 50 px too tall and lose `stale`, which is a line to
trim rather than a composition to rebuild.

Five things the grid measured that nothing else had, all printed on the three pages rather than
reconciled away: **the ring's cell is bigger than the region's** (res 4, 26 km against res 5,
9.9 km — two of the four distances are the wrong way round as scales); at the grain the street is
drawn at, **this house's own cell also holds two of somebody else's sensors**; the grid **cannot tell
the room from the wall outside at all**, because this node's three sensors carry one coordinate; the
ring reaches **14.7 km** where `presets/bali.env` declares 8; and two of seven child cells reach
**6 m** outside their own parent while indexing to it exactly.

## The first round, short

| | target | shipped | A | B | C |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| the first screen says everything, at 390 | five of five | four | **five** | **five** | **five** |
| issues named with a number, first screen at 1440 / 390 | all five | none marked | 2 / 1 | **4** / 2 | 3 / **3** |
| empty share at 1440 · as written / discounting decoration | ≤ 30 % | 35.3 / 64.4 | 69.3 | 71.8 | 70.5 / 70.8 |
| empty share at 390 | ≤ 20 % | 21.4 / 46.8 | 46.5 | 52.5 | **43.2** |
| page height at 1440, in screens | ≤ 4 | 5.7 | 5.2 | 4.2 | **3.1** |
| page height at 390 | ≤ 8 | 8.9 | 8.4 | **6.9** | **5.5** |
| card kinds | 4 | 0 declared, 24 grammars | **4** | 3 | 2 |
| numerals with nothing to compare them to | 0 | 26 drawn, none marked | **0 of 70** | **0 of 47** | **0 of 26** |
| components with no link in or out | 0 | **47 of 47** | 2 | **1** | 2 |
| the wall at 1920, on a 1,080 px screen | 1,080 | 1,080 (**1,052 on 900 at 1440**) | **1,142** | **1,550** | **1,080** |
| every issue line on the wall ≥ 9 mm | yes | **7.5 mm** | **10.1** | 8.4 | 8.4 |

---

## The three real choices

**1 · Is the page read by issue, by place, or by grid?** A and B organise by issue; C, D, E and F by
place; G, H and I by the grid itself, with the four distances demoted to a word on a reading. It
decides what a household is taught to ask — *which issue is loud*, *which part of my place is the
problem*, or *what is known about this ground, and how finely*. C's cost is the mirror of its claim:
air appears in three zones, so reading one issue end to end means walking the page. The third
round's cost is bigger and is stated with each of the three.

**2 · T2's 30 % and 20 % do not survive contact with any composition.** The best first screen
measured is 43.2 % empty against a target of 20 %. The shipped page reads 21.4 % only because a
decorative full-bleed drawing counts as a mark; discount it and it is 46.8 %, the same neighbourhood
as all three. So: restate the targets against the measure that discounts decoration and set them
near 45 % at 390 and 65 % at 1440 — which every direction already beats — or make the page
materially denser than any of these, or put a picture back behind the first screen, which is what
the page does today and what the complaint calls too much empty space. **This one needs answering
before Phase 2 starts**, because it is the difference between building a page and building a table.

**3 · The wall was C's, and now five pages fit it.** C, D, G, H and I are all 1,080 px on a 1,080 px
screen; E and F overrun by 53 and 50; A by 62 and B by 470. The paragraph below is the first round's
and still describes what a wall that does not fit actually loses.

**3a · The wall is C's, of the first three.** Measured at 1920 dark, on a 1,080 px screen: C is 1,080 px with nothing
below the fold; A is 1,142 and loses the node name, **`stale`** and "Answer on Telegram"; B is 1,550
and loses a whole issue row as well. A wall does not scroll, so a household reads a number and is
never shown the word saying it is old — the September skeleton review's **S-01**, which v0.53 closed
at 1920 and left open at 1440. If A or B is the pick, its wall is a separate composition and not the
same page at a larger size; that is work Phase 2 has to plan for. All three do put a provenance word
on every wall number, which closes **L2** whichever way it goes.

Two smaller ones, recorded so they are not decided by accident: **the stack may not be a card** (B
and C dissolve it, which takes T3's four kinds down to three or two), and **the plan only explains
something in C**, where it is the ring's own drawing rather than a card in a band.

---

## The question, in one paragraph

Nine drawings of the same evening now, on the same frozen layer, from the same file. The first fork
is no longer which one: it is **whether the four distances stay in the navigation**. A to F keep them
— C organises the page by place and is the shortest of the first three; D makes the resolution ladder
the spine and is the only composition anywhere that puts the privacy argument where a household can
see it; E makes the neighbourhood the spine and answers *is it me or is it everywhere* as something
countable; F changes C as little as possible. G, H and I drop them: G is one cell at a time and makes
a place sendable as a URL, H turns one dial and makes resolution into provenance, and I is one
surface with the issue as a layer, which is the shortest, densest and best-measured page of the nine
on every target except card kinds. **Which one should be built** — and three things that decide with
it: **do the four distances navigate, or only label custody**; **does `/issues` publish a value per
station**, which G and I need and which the fenced median exists to prevent; and **do the emptiness
targets move to the measure that discounts decoration**, after nine compositions have missed them.
Name anything from the other eight you want carried over; Phase 2 builds one page, not a merge.

## If the answer is A

Then: the stack stays a card; the index is deleted as an object; the hero is the first row with a
`lead` class and not a component of its own; the loop band keeps the funnel; and two problems come
first — only two issues are named on the first screen at 1440 and one at 390, because the lead takes
the whole fold, and the wall is 62 px too tall.

## If the answer is B

Then: `ANATOMY` gains a `matrix` band and loses `stack`; the wall needs its own composition, because
the matrix overruns it by 470 px; the per-row sentence at 14 px is the first thing to check at 390;
and `check_ui`'s card-kind count becomes three.

## If the answer is C

Then: `layout()` orders by distance and not by issue, which is the one change that touches the
renderer's own shape rather than its lists; the plan gets drawn from `/place/geojson` with the res-9
mesh and the res-8 outline rather than being an artboard; every reading keeps its link to the same
issue at the next distance, which is C's answer to the scatter; and `check_ui`'s card-kind count
becomes two unless the row and the stack come back somewhere.

## If the answer is D, E or F

All three need one thing from the node and it is small: **`/issues` carries the cell id and the
resolution per distance**, so the page can show the scale without inventing it. That is a field on a
stack cell, not an endpoint, and `app/ground.py` already calls `latlng_to_cell`, `grid_disk` and
`cell_to_children`, so nothing has to be built — only published. `make-h3.mjs` is the working
reference for what to publish.

**D** also wants `PRESENCE_RES_FLOOR` and `RETICULUM_PRESENCE_RES` on the same read, because the line
across the ladder is drawn from them. **E** wants per-station coordinates, which `/sensors` already
answers, and it wants somebody to decide whether a cell may show a value — today it can only show
that a station is there, because the node publishes the ring as one fenced median and a number per
cell would be the page computing. **F** wants nothing beyond the cell ids.

And all three inherit the same three sentences, which are not optional: the grid cannot tell indoors
from outdoors, it cannot tell mine from the street's at the grain the street is drawn at, and its
containment is exact in the index and approximate on the ground.

## If the answer is H, the modular one

Then Phase 2 is the contract, not a page: `kit-page.js` becomes the node's renderer, a pack's
`dashboard` contribution in its pack.yaml is one static file that calls `register`, and the shell
is the only thing the node ships as its own. The ten sections in the prototype are the first ten
contributions — the renderer's own four (claims, grain, asks, measure) and six from packs (place,
air-quality, earth, reticulum, meshtastic, hardware). Two decisions ride with it: **live tiles or not** —
the page sends a tile server the square being looked at; under the rule now in place the plan is
the default from resolution 9 inward and the tiles show at 8 and coarser, so the dial as it opens
sends twelve tile requests and one stop in sends nothing — and **which sections stay in Now**, because nine of them are twelve
screens on a phone and the Network view already has a home for the radio.

## If the answer is G, H or I

These need two things from the node. The first is small and the second is not:

1. **A plate per cell, on `/issues`** — the cell, the cells around it, each one's parent, area and
   what is read in it. `app/ground.py` already calls `latlng_to_cell`, `grid_disk` and
   `cell_to_children`; nothing has to be built, only published, and it measures **3.0 kB** for the
   plate a reader is standing on. `make-h3.mjs` is the working reference for the shape. H also wants
   each source's declared footprint as a compacted cell set — the numbers it is computed from are
   already in the packs.
2. **A value per station.** G and I show one station's own 15-minute mean. `/issues` publishes the
   street as a single **fenced median** and never a value per station, and the fence is deliberate.
   **This is a STOP.** Nothing gets built on G or I without an answer, and "no" is a real answer:
   both still work showing that a station is there and how far away it is, which is what E does — it
   costs G its numeral on most screens and costs I the reason to press a cell.

**H needs neither.** Everything on its page is a count, an area or a footprint, and all of them come
from what the node already declares. If the per-station question is a "no", H is the only one of the
three that survives it intact.

And all three inherit the same sentences, which are not optional: the grid cannot tell indoors from
outdoors; it cannot tell mine from the street's at the grain the street is drawn at; its containment
is exact in the index and approximate on the ground; and **the plate ends** — two steps out is what
this node published, and a page that drew a door past it would be drawing the planet.

---

## What Phase 2 inherits whichever it is

The four shared findings in `DIRECTIONS_2026-09.md` — the as-of under the ask, "nothing has been
asked" as a sentence of its own, a pack's own unit and comparison travelling with its contribution,
and the line's source named once — are not part of the choice. Nor are the four card kinds, the
`data-num`/`data-cmp` pair, the `data-ref` link, or the refused page saying three things.

`tests/visual/measure.mjs` is the one measuring script and it already computes T1–T7 and T9. Phase
2's gates read the same numbers.

**Three things to fix in Phase 2 that the drawings get wrong.** The ρ caption is 8.8 mm on
every wall, just under the floor. `data-num` on a readout was a label before it
was a key, and a gate that walks `[data-num]` has to be able to tell which issue a numeral belongs
to. And the wireframe views carry one component and one link, so they pass T5 by being almost empty
— a real Network view will not.

---

## Not done, and not claimed

The first set of renders fell back to system-ui for Funnel Sans and Figtree, because the node serves
its faces by flat name from an allowlist and the rig served the directory they live in. Every number
here is from a re-render with all three faces loading; the shipped baseline was unaffected and
re-measuring it returned the same numbers to the decimal.

No live data: node #1 and node #2 were not contacted, and nothing on pai-clean was written — no
setting, no restart. `en` only. No real wall in a real room. The committed fixture carries no open
ask, so no drawing shows the green button in use. The funnel's 2×2 axes are inferred, because
`PLANETAI_Response_Funnel_Briefing_2026-09-10.md` and
`PLANETAI_Models_by_Node_Class_2026-09-14.md` are in the PLANETAI project and on neither disk nor any
branch here.

## Shipped, 15–16 September

Direction H, revised, is in production. The dashboard is now a shell, a contract and twelve
sections — six of the renderer's own (claims, grain, asks, measure, ground, sensors) and six from
packs (forecast, satellite/earth, reticulum, meshtastic, hardware, trust) — registered against
`window.PAI.register`, and rendered stage by stage in the order the loop runs: observe, decide,
act, measure. The loop is the page's spine, not a decoration on it; see `docs/PACKS.md`'s new "A
dashboard section" for the contract a pack author writes against.

### The commits

`git log --oneline f228bd9..HEAD`, oldest first:

| commit | what it did |
|---|---|
| `0025d36` | publishes the H3 geometry the page now navigates by — the resolution ladder, the plates, the grain table (Task 1). |
| `7e30fcb` | publishes what each declared source's footprint covers, and what the radio announces about where (Task 2). |
| `f9fe0c8` | fixes a footprint of zero or less: it publishes an empty claim instead of crashing `/issues` (Task 2, fix round 1). |
| `d91e7d8` | publishes each station, the issue's declared metrics, the open-asks ledger and the mesh state (Task 3). |
| `9c9b078` | wires the geometry into `/issues`' own response — the numbers the dial turns on (Task 4). |
| `5db22ba` | adds the `MAP_TILES` setting, off until a keeper turns it on (Task 5). |
| `4669aad` | fixes the `MAP_TILES` test to check the setting's real default source, not a fallback the test supplied (Task 5 fix). |
| `e08b749` | makes the measuring rig answer the node's own endpoints from this repo, offline, instead of falling through to a running container (Task 5b). |
| `eed9e8d` | fixes the rig to replay the fixture and read settings under node #1's own environment, not code defaults (Task 5b fix). |
| `685fe1a` | makes a broken rig child loud instead of a silent empty 200, and folds `/issues` + `/settings` into one child (Task 5b fix). |
| `7df6276` | assembles the dashboard as a shell, a contract and ten sections, in the three files the node has always served — grown to twelve in review (Task 6). |
| `709b3e5` | fixes the Set up pane (it was drawn but inert), stops a press from defeating `MAP_TILES`, and restores Arrange (Task 6, fix round 1). |
| `46018b0` | fixes the asks wall fragment to survive a missing `/rho`, and fixes Default to restore the order sections registered with (Task 6, fix round 2). |
| `f85a46c` | adds the visual gate (`tests/visual/gate.sh`), fixes three routes to be hermetic, and shows the four previously-unpopulated figures for the first time under `PAI_RICH=1` (Task 8). |

Task 7 (the tiles switch) needed no commit of its own — it shipped inside Task 6's assembly and was
verified by reading the code rather than building it again. Task 9 (proving on `pai-clean`) made no
commit; see below.

### The numbers this page measured when it shipped

These are `tests/visual/gate.sh`'s own recorded baselines, at commit `f85a46c`, measured by its
hermetic rig (`tests/visual/measure.mjs`'s `serveNodeAPI()` — no node, no container, no network) —
and Task 6's report for the section count and the `/issues` body size:

| what | 390 px | 1440 px |
|---|---|---|
| page height | 8,267 px (gate fails above 8,928, an 8% margin) | 5,261 px (gate fails above 5,682) |
| empty share of the first screen (T2) | 37.7% (gate fails above 43.7%, a 6-point margin) | 61.3% (gate fails above 67.3%) |

The wall, at 1920×1080 dark, is 1,080 px — it still fits the screen it is drawn for. Twelve sections
are registered; none fails to render. `/issues`' body is 227.1 kB of a 400 kB budget — the claims'
own compacted-cell boundaries (`cells_ll`, Task 6's ruling A2) cost 68 kB of that, which is what
keeps the decide stage's claim cards drawing a picture instead of only a count.

**These numbers are not comparable with Phase 1's**, in `docs/design/REDESIGN_2026-09_ground.md`
above. Phase 1 was measured against a bootstrapped container on `pai-clean` that nobody can
reconstruct (Task 5b's ruling found the offline rig drifts from it by about 2% in page height even
once the rig replays the fixture under node #1's own settings). Phase 2's own thresholds are set
from what this hermetic rig measures against this page, never against Phase 1's figures — which is
exactly what `gate.sh`'s own comment says, and exactly why a future implementer whose page grows
must move `gate.sh`'s baselines rather than reach for the older document.

### The proving run that did not happen, and how to do it

Task 9 was supposed to prove this branch on `pai-clean`, the VM used for the September UX review.
The VM is healthy — `limactl list` shows it `Running`, four containers up, reachable — and the host
worktree is mounted inside it, read-only. **The run did not happen because this session's own
permission sandbox refused every action that would have deployed the branch**, not because the
machine or the branch was unfit: `rsync` into `~/planetai` was classified "Irreversible Local
Destruction", `mv`-ing the existing `app/` aside was "Modify Shared Resources", and so was
`planetai backup` and `docker compose build`. None of that reflects a defect in the branch; it
reflects an agent correctly declining to push a live deploy through a boundary meant to stop it.

Run this from a terminal that is not sandboxed against it — the commands are the ones
`task-9-report.md` worked out, unchanged:

```bash
limactl shell pai-clean -- bash -c '
  cd ~/planetai
  planetai backup
  rsync -a --exclude=.git --exclude=.env --exclude=backups/ --exclude=data/ \
    --exclude=out/ --exclude=exports/ --exclude=VERSION \
    "/Users/tomasdiez/Documents/Claude/Projects/FAB CITY/planetai-node/" ./
  docker compose up -d --build app
  sleep 5
  curl -fsS localhost:8080/health
'
```

Then run `tests/visual/measure.mjs` from `planetai-design` with `PAI_LIVE=1` against the VM's
forwarded port, with the node's `ADMIN_TOKEN` — read from `~/planetai/.env` on the VM, never echoed
or pasted anywhere — and step through Task 9's Step 2/3 checklist. `init.sql`'s migrations are
additive (`IF NOT EXISTS`, `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING`), so applying them to the live schema should be
safe, but the `planetai backup` above still comes first: this VM's database is two schema versions
behind what this branch expects.

**What is still unproven, because only this run proves it:**

- the tile-request count on a live node — the hermetic rig counts requests it fulfils itself, not
  requests a real tile server would see;
- the `MAP_TILES` toggle at resolutions 8 and 9, where the rule that a press may only reduce what
  leaves the house actually has a live tile server on the other end;
- the wall stepping by itself, unattended, in a real browser rather than Playwright's `reduced-motion`
  render;
- **the first look at all four of the Sentinel strip, this node's own AlphaEarth record, the trust
  card and the forecast card populated.** Nobody has ever seen any of the four with real data behind
  it — the hermetic rig's `PAI_RICH=1` (Task 8) serves a hand-written stand-in, which is proof the
  sections can draw populated content, not a look at what a real node actually has.

### Decisions taken during the build that the owner has not seen

Six rulings in `progress.md`, and two more worth carrying, changed what the product does rather
than how the work got there:

- **Tiles are off by default, and a press can only ever reduce what leaves the house.** The
  prototype let a pressed `?base=sat` link win over the setting outright — one click could have sent
  a household's own kilometre to a tile server against the keeper's own choice in Set up. The fixed
  rule: `plan` (nothing sent) is always offered; `satellite`/`street map` are offered, and only then
  pressable, when `MAP_TILES` is on and the resolution is coarser than 9. Cost: a keeper who wants
  tiles has to turn them on in Set up first — which is the decision already taken, just now actually
  enforced.
- **The claims publish their boundaries, at a cost of 68 kB.** Without the compacted-cell shapes
  (`cells_ll`) on each claim, the decide stage's claim cards would have counts and no picture, and
  "resolution is provenance" — the argument this direction is built on — stops being visible. The
  `/issues` body grew from 159 kB to 227.1 kB to buy that back, inside the 400 kB budget.
- **`/rho` and `/trust` joined what the page reads.** Both are existing routes the page being
  replaced already read; without them the measure stage (`/rho`) and the decide stage's trust card
  would be empty on a live node. Cost: one more GET per page load for each.
- **Trust, forecast, Arrange and the whole Set up pane were restored after the port dropped them.**
  The prototype's drawing had none of the four — Set up was a wireframe, and trust/forecast/Arrange
  were capabilities of the page being replaced that direction H's mock never carried. A port that
  drops a working capability is the one thing a port may not do, so all four came back: trust as an
  eleventh section, forecast as a twelfth, Arrange as a mode over Now, and Set up ported close to
  verbatim (and then, in review, found silently inert — its buttons drawn but unwired to anything —
  and fixed). Cost: four more surfaces to maintain that the node already maintained before this port.
- **A node with no coordinates gets an honest fallback, not a hexagon grid over the Gulf of Guinea.**
  `/health` reports `0, 0` for an unset `NODE_LAT`/`NODE_LON`, and H3 answers for `(0, 0)` as readily
  as anywhere else, so a freshly-plugged-in node would have been shown a real-looking grid over open
  ocean and told it was its own ground. The fix draws `static/node-ground.svg` and says the node has
  not been sited yet. Cost: none identified; this closes a bug the previous page also had, unnoticed.
- **The wall draws only the first five module fragments; the rest are counted, not shown.** This is
  the prototype's own rule (`MAX_FRAGMENTS = 5` — at three metres, ten small columns are unreadable),
  carried over unchanged. On this node the asks fragment registers eighth, so it never appears on the
  wall itself, only in "+3 more in Now." ρ is already on the wall separately, so little is lost, but
  nobody has decided whether five is the right number or whether fragments should be ordered by
  importance instead of registration order — see the open questions below.
- **A zero-or-negative declared footprint publishes an empty claim rather than crashing `/issues`.**
  A keeper setting a radius-shaped setting to 0 to disable a source used to be able to take the whole
  dashboard down with it. The fix does not invent a radius — the one thing a claim may never do — it
  publishes a claim with an empty covering and a 0 km² footprint, which the page already knows how to
  draw as nothing.
- **The satellite strip draws from this node's own `/earth/frame.png`, never from the design repo's
  copies.** The prototype loaded four PNGs out of the prototype's own folder; a live node has no
  access to that folder and no reason to trust it. Cost: on a node whose earth pack has never run,
  the strip is one honest line instead of a picture, until a keeper runs `planetai run earth fetch`.

### What was deliberately not built

- **A pack-served `dashboard.js`.** A pack's own dashboard contribution living as a file the node
  loads, rather than code merged into the shared shell, needs a route the node does not have. STOP:
  the node serves exactly three static files today (`dashboard.js`, `dashboard.css`, `index.html`)
  and nothing else; a fourth file means a new route, which is the next phase's decision, not this
  one's.
- **The open hardware manager and local making.** Both are named in the prototype's drawing as
  packs a node could run; neither pack exists. STOP: there is nothing to register a section for — the
  hardware section already on the page shows the open-hardware-manager row honestly as "not
  connected" rather than inventing one.
- **Per-section switches in Set up.** A keeper can turn `MAP_TILES` on or off, and can hide or
  reorder any section through Arrange, but cannot switch a whole section off from Set up the way a
  setting is switched. STOP: Set up's ported pane is the generic settings form; wiring it to
  section-level on/off is a design decision about where that control belongs (Set up vs. Arrange),
  not a missing line of code.

### Open questions

- **Is five the right number of wall fragments, and should they be ordered by importance rather than
  by registration?** On this node the order means the asks fragment never appears on the wall at all
  — nobody has weighed that against readability at three metres, which is the reason the limit
  exists in the first place.
- **Do the emptiness targets move now that a tenth composition has measured against them?** T2's
  30%/20% targets have now missed on every direction measured, including this one shipped at 61.3%
  (1440) and 37.7% (390) — both inside `gate.sh`'s own margin around what this page happens to
  measure, neither near the original target. `docs/design/DIRECTIONS_2026-09.md`'s own second
  finding already asked whether the targets should move to the measure that discounts decoration;
  this page is one more data point saying they have still not been met by anything built.
