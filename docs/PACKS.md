# Packs

A pack is a folder in `packs/`. It carries rules, Index cells, or an adapter for a new source. The core knows nothing
about air, water or heat; the packs do. Eighteen ship in `packs/`.

```
packs/<id>/
  pack.yaml     id, name, description, kind (data | code), version, pip:, env:
  rules.yml     alerts: SQL that returns rows, one message per row
  cells.yml     Index cells: SQL that returns one `value`
  adapter.py    a new source; code packs only
  channels.yml  what a pack's own metrics ARE — ambient, enclosure, index, etc.
  README.md     where the thresholds come from, what the pack assumes
```

## Data packs

YAML only. Anyone can write one. Rules read `stats` (24-hour rolling, per sensor and metric), `readings_1h` (hourly
means, all history) and `observations` (portals and models). Postgres does the maths, including `corr()`. The SQL runs
as a read-only role (`planetai_ro`, in `init.sql`): every table but `settings`, and no writes, so a rule cannot read a
token into an alert text or change a row.

```yaml
- id: indoor_pm25_high
  level: act                 # info | warn | act
  cooldown_minutes: 120
  sql: SELECT sensor_id, name, mean_15m FROM stats WHERE local AND indoor AND metric='pm25' AND mean_15m > 35
  message:
    en: "Indoor PM2.5 at {name} is {mean_15m:.0f} µg/m³. Purifier on, windows shut."
    id: "PM2.5 dalam ruangan di {name} {mean_15m:.0f} µg/m³. Nyalakan pembersih udara, tutup jendela."
```

Every column the message uses must come from the SQL. `make lint` checks that, plus unknown columns, cells without a
`value`, and cooldowns over a fortnight (add `long_cooldown_ok: true` if that is deliberate).

A rule can compute something for the report instead of interrupting anyone:

```yaml
- id: digest
  contributes: report        # no level, no cooldown, no message: this is never sent
  sql: SELECT round(avg(mean_1h)) AS inside FROM stats WHERE local AND indoor AND metric='pm25'
```

Its first row lands in the report bundle under the rule's own id (`bundle.digest`), where the node's own report
reads it and a model, if one is reachable, may quote from it. A contributor has no message and is never sent;
`make lint` refuses a rule with both, and refuses a rule with neither, which could fire and reach nobody.

A cell:

```yaml
- cell: "Environmental|Community"
  unit: "PM2.5 µg/m³ 24h mean"
  state: live                # live | partial | mock. The core demotes live to partial below min_buckets.
  min_buckets: 12
  sql: SELECT avg(mean_24h) AS value FROM stats WHERE local AND indoor AND metric='pm25'
```

`state` is provenance, not confidence. `live` means measured here; `partial` means derived or a model; never claim `live`
for a model.

### Channel roles

A pack that adds a metric says what it IS in `channels.yml`, keyed on `(source, metric)`:

```yaml
- { source: my-sensor, metric: co2, role: ambient, comparable: true, unit: "ppm" }
```

Five roles: `ambient` (the air, water or land at a place — comparable between sensors there), `enclosure` (the
inside of the instrument's own box — a BME680 sealed inside a radio reports the box, not the street, so this is
never averaged as ambient), `device_health` (the instrument talking about itself, e.g. battery), `derived`
(computed by us from other readings), and `index` (a vendor's own composite number, never pooled with anyone
else's). `config/channels.yml` has the core declarations; `make lint` checks every metric against `app/sources.py`.
A role is keyed per source and metric, not per device: every sensor an adapter drives shares it, so a node whose
hardware differs from that adapter's usual shape (an external probe on a Meshtastic pod) cannot override it yet.

## Code packs

`adapter.py` with `fetch(hc) -> (sensors, readings)`, the same contract as `app/sources.py`. Off unless
`PACKS_ALLOW_CODE=1`: a pack runs with the node's privileges, so read it first.

Dependencies and settings are declared in `pack.yaml`; `planetai packs` lists what is loaded and what is missing, and
`planetai packs install` installs the libraries into the image once and
adds the settings to `.env` under a dated marker:

```yaml
pip: [earthengine-api]
env:
  - "# earth-engine: project id, or blank to read it from the key file"
  - "EE_PROJECT="
```

No padding after `=`: a value pasted after spaces becomes `VAR= value`, which the shell runs as a command.

A pack that needs a key or a service must log once and return nothing when it is missing. It must never take the node
down. `packs/earth-engine` is the worked example: a dependency, a credential, four remote datasets, and it idles until
configured.

## Scripts

A pack can ship scripts: things you ask for rather than things that run on a schedule.

```bash
planetai run earth-engine timelapse --n 4 --gap 5
```

They run inside the app container, where the dependencies are, and write to `out/`, the one writable path. `planetai run`
alone lists them.

## A dashboard section

**What the page draws is `GET /issues`, and that document is `issues-v0`.** Every section reads off
globals bound from one fetch of it, so its top level is the contract a section is written against. It
carries `"schema": "issues-v0"`; `tools/check_wire.py` holds the top-level key list in
`tests/data/wire/issues-v0.json`, and a key cannot appear or vanish under a section without somebody
editing that file. If a node ever answers a version the page does not know, the page says one sentence
and draws what it recognises — it does not blank. A version bumps only on a breaking change, and the
bump is a `docs/decisions/` entry.

A pack can put a section on the dashboard. It registers one object with the page contract and the
page renders it in the stage it belongs to — observe, decide, act, measure — in the order the loop
runs, and folds its explanations at the foot:

```js
window.PAI.register({
  id: 'meshtastic',        // required, unique; becomes the band's DOM id
  pack: 'meshtastic',      // required; your pack's id
  stage: 'observe',        // required; observe · decide · act · measure, nothing else
  title: 'The mesh in this house',   // required; the band's kicker, in the house voice
  render(ctx) { … },       // required; the body. Captions belong here, explanations do not
  order: 41,               // optional (default 50); position within the stage, lower first
  needs: ['H3.radio.mesh'],// optional (default none); globals this section reads off window
  controls(ctx) { … },     // optional: a control strip (a toggle, a selector)
  wall(ctx) { … },         // optional: what this section contributes to the wall at ctx.RES
  notes(ctx) { … },        // optional: the explanations, as [{ id, text }]
});
```

`id`, `pack`, `stage`, `title` and `render` are the ones the page actually checks for; leave one out,
or misspell a stage, and the section is dropped with a line under "Registration problems" rather
than drawn broken. `needs` is read against `window`: each string is a DOTTED PATH resolved from `window` one key at a
time, so `'H3.radio.mesh'` is `window.H3 && window.H3.radio && window.H3.radio.mesh`, and the test is
`!= null` — a path that resolves to `null` or `undefined` at any step counts as absent, and `0`,
`''` and `[]` do not. (A node whose geometry failed publishes `geometry: null`, so `'H3.nav'` is
absent there and the ground band says so.) When what a path names is not there, the band
prints one honest line — *"The `<pack>` pack has nothing here yet: `<what>` is not on this
node"* — never a blank and never a guess. When `render()` itself throws, the band prints *"`<pack>` ·
`<id>` did not render: `<message>`. A failure is not an answer, so the rest of the page is still
here"* and every other section still draws.

What a section may not do: invent a fifth card kind (readout · stack · series · row are the four,
and a drawing is a drawing inside a card); colour a state by hue; print a numeral without
`data-num`/`data-cmp`; leave a component with no `data-ref` in or out; put its explanation in its
body — that belongs in `notes()`, gathered at the bottom of the page where every note lives folded.
None of this is enforced by the contract itself; all of it is measured by `tests/visual/gate.sh`.

Today a section lives inline in `app/static/dashboard.js`, because the node serves a fixed list of
static files by name and nothing else — `index.html`, `dashboard.js`, three stylesheets, two SVGs, two
JSON files and the fonts. The twenty-four sections shipped there are the reference for the shape
above. Serving a pack's own `dashboard.js` — so a pack could carry its section as a file the node loads rather than code merged into the shell —
needs a route the node does not have yet. That is the next phase, not this one. Proposing a section
back today is sending the file with its `render()` and its `notes()`.

## The hero

The lead of the page is a slot. Whichever issue the node's rule puts first, the page draws its
`hero` from `GET /issues` and nothing else there, so the page knows nothing about air, heat or the
sea. The contract belongs to the **issue**, not the pack: air is fed by three packs and has one hero.
A core issue declares it in its `app/issues/<issue>.yml`:

```yaml
hero:
  sign: sign-coast          # required; a symbol id in app/static/signs.svg
  pictogram: pix-coast      # optional; a symbol drawn at hero size. Absent: the sign, at hero size
  numeral: region           # optional; a distance or one of the issue's readouts. Default: the
                            #   nearest distance with a value, the same one the sentence leads with
  unit: m                   # required
  dp: 1                     # required; keep it the issue's own, or the sentence and the numeral
                            #   print the same reading two ways
  rule:                     # optional; absent means no rule under the numeral
    min: 0
    max: 4                  # the end of the drawing, not a limit; a reading past it sits on the end
    ends: { en: [flat, rough], id: [tenang, bergelombang], es: [en calma, picado] }
    dots: [region]          # the distances that may appear on the rule
    line: false             # true draws the issue's own line; it must declare one
  clock: time               # time · date. A yearly record says date, and the stamp prints when it
                            #   looked and when it looks next
```

The engine fills it every poll into `issues[<issue>].hero` with tonight's values, and names the
leader in `lead: {issue, by}`. **An issue with no `hero:` is watched, drawn in the matrix and listed
under the lead, and never leads**: the rule skips it. `make test` refuses a hero whose sign or
pictogram is not in `signs.svg`, whose numeral is neither a distance the issue fills nor one of its
readouts, whose rule dots name a distance the issue does not have, or whose rule draws a line the
issue does not declare.

A pack that brings an issue of its own will declare its hero the same way, in the `issue.yml` beside
its `pack.yaml`. The node does not load an issue from a pack yet; until it does, a new issue is a new
file in `app/issues/`.

## What ships

The `issue` column is which band of the dashboard a pack feeds. It comes from the pack's `domain:`,
except for a cross-domain pack, whose rules are claimed one by one in `app/issues/*.yml`. A pack that
reaches no issue and is not named as deliberately outside them fails `tests/test_issues.py` — see
[`DOMAINS.md`](DOMAINS.md).

| pack | kind | issue | what |
|---|---|---|---|
| air-quality | data | air | PM2.5 rules (inside/outside, spikes), cells |
| xiaomi-air | code | air | Xiaomi / Mi Home purifiers read on the LAN over miio/MIoT: PM2.5, temperature, humidity, filter life, indoor |
| heat | data | heat | apparent temperature, heat stress, nights over 28 °C, a Social cell |
| insight | data | air (`agreement`, `rhythm`) | the air three ways, contributed to every report; daily agreement between indoor, street and model |
| nearby | data | air | the ring of other people's stations: is this address worse than everywhere, or is everywhere worse — no cell, by design |
| season | data | air | the same ring across time: is this week worse than its own preceding two months, paired per station — no cell, same reason as `nearby` |
| forecast | code | — feeds air and heat | wind and rain for the next day, from BMKG and Open-Meteo — context for the report, no alerts, no cell |
| trust | data | — the instruments | coverage, frozen channels, collocated disagreement — needs a week of a sensor before it names it; all three `info`, no cell, by design |
| cold-start | data | air (`modelled_air_today`, `sensor_vs_model`), heat (`hotter_than_normal`) | day one with no hardware: modelled air, normals |
| open-data-health | data | — the loop and the Index | a CKAN portal's maintenance state → Governance\|City |
| coast | code | coast | waves, swell, sea temperature (Open-Meteo Marine, key-free) |
| posidonia | data | coast | thermal stress on the Posidonia seagrass meadow, from the sea temperature `coast` fetches; written for Menorca |
| earth-engine | code | — Dynamic World, Sentinel-2, VIIRS | tree cover, built-up, NDVI, night lights (Google Earth Engine) |
| earth | code | land | this node's own copy of the AlphaEarth embeddings: the land change computed here, and a picture of the place for every year |
| place | code | — the ground, its own band | what is around the node from OpenStreetMap, in PostGIS: buildings, shops, schools, clinics, roads, green, walking distances |
| thingdata | code | — repair knowledge, its own catalogue | a ThingData server's things, guides and stories, and how much of the catalogue anyone has written down how to fix |
| make | code | — places, not numbers | the nearest active fab labs and what each can do, from the Fab Lab Network directory — display-only, no metrics, no cell and no alert, by design |
| example-cooking-hours | data | air | a worked example |

`make` is the only pack that stores no number at all. Its rows are `kind='facility'`: a place with
a name and a point, so an alert can end somewhere a person can go instead of on a reading. It has no
`cells.yml` and the reason is structural rather than a convention — `custody` is generated as
`kind='child' OR (local AND kind<>'peer')`, and a facility is `local=False`, so it could not reach an
Index cell even if somebody wrote the SQL. A fab lab down the road is not this node's measurement of
anything. Its `rules.yml` is empty for a matching reason: a lab opening is news on the scale of a
year, and the line it produces belongs in *other* packs' asks, at the moment somebody has just been
told they need something made.

Read [`packs/make/README.md`](../packs/make/README.md) before enabling it. The Fab Lab Network
directory is **not openly licensed** — each lab retains copyright in its own record and no data
licence is published — and the Foundation's decision to read it covers the Foundation, not each
node's operator.

Land's number is `earth`'s and only `earth`'s: the change this node computed itself, from embeddings
it downloaded. `earth-engine` contributes land's readouts (built and trees, from Dynamic World) but
not its change figure. It used to publish a `land_change_score`, and v0.33.1 retired it because it
was a second number for one idea with different provenance — the reason is in
[`packs/earth/README.md`](../packs/earth/README.md). Land does not fall back to it, and it does not
fall back to anything: `observations` keeps the latest row per source per metric forever, so a node
that ran the pack before the retirement still holds that row, and reading it would put a number
retired a year ago on the wall as this year's answer. With no record, land is `none` and says how to
fetch one.

Ten more ideas, with who might write them: [`PACK_IDEAS.md`](PACK_IDEAS.md).

## Contributing one

Fork, add the folder, `make lint`, open a PR. The README must say where the thresholds came from and what the pack does
not know. Thresholds for Kuta Selatan are not thresholds for Barcelona; say which place you wrote for.
