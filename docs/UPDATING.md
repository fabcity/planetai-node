# Updating

```bash
planetai update
```

In order: back up the database (and refuse to go on if that fails); fetch tags and pull, or download the tarball if the
node has no repository access, check its checksum **and its signature**, and stop dead if either is wrong; apply
`init.sql`, which is idempotent, to the live database; merge new keys from
`.env.example` into `.env` under a dated marker; rebuild the image; restart; run the doctor; report the schema before
and after.

`update.sh` runs from a copy of itself, because pulling rewrites the file bash is reading and it would otherwise continue
from a random offset in the new file.

## Updates are signed

Since v0.60 the tarball arrives with a signature, and a node checks it before it unpacks anything. If a node refuses an
update, **that is the node doing its job** — it means the download was not signed by the key the node trusts, and the
right response is to stop, not to work around it.

```
xx this download is not signed by the PLANETAI release key. Nothing was installed and nothing on this machine changed.
```

Nothing on the machine changed when you see that. Try once more, in case you were on a captive-portal wifi that served
its own page instead of the file. If it says it twice, do not go looking for a way past it — say so. `SECURITY.md` is
how.

The checksum and the signature are not the same check. The checksum is served from the same place as the tarball, so it
only tells you the download arrived whole; whoever can write one can write the other. The signature is made with a key
that is not on the web server. `planetai version` prints the fingerprint your node checks against, and `planetai doctor`
has a row saying whether the last update was verified.

Two other things it can say, both with the fix attached:

**`no ssh-keygen on this machine`** — a bare container or a very thin Linux install. `sudo apt-get install -y
openssh-client`, or `sudo pacman -S openssh` on Arch. Every Mac already has it.

**`could not fetch … planetai-node.tar.gz.sig`** — the site is reachable but that one file is not. Usually a partial
deploy. Wait, then try again.

There is an escape hatch, `PLANETAI_UNSIGNED=1`, which accepts an unsigned tarball and says in red that it did. It is
for building and throwing away a test tarball on a dev machine. It is not for a node anybody relies on, and `planetai
doctor` will show that the node took one.

## If it fails

**`git pull failed`**: local changes. The update clears `.DS_Store` itself before it pulls, so if you edited files in
the node folder, `git stash`, then update again.

**`backup failed — not updating`**: the update refused on purpose. `planetai backup` alone shows why; `planetai storage`
shows where it is trying to write.

**`app answering ✗`**: `docker compose logs app | tail -40`. Paste it.

## Rollback

```bash
git checkout v0.17        # or the tag before
docker compose build app  # the code is inside the image; a restart alone keeps running the new one
planetai restart
planetai restore backups/<node>-<date>.sql.gz    # only if the schema went forward and you need the old shape
```

A node installed from the tarball has no tags to check out. Point it at an earlier release on the mirror (below) and
update: `PLANETAI_GET=https://github.com/fabcity/planetai-node/releases/download/<tag> planetai update`. The same
checksum and signature checks apply.

## Testers without repository access

`update` downloads `planetai.fab.city/node0/get/planetai-node.tar.gz`, checks its checksum and its signature, and
unpacks over the folder keeping `.env`, backups, exports and packs. Publish a new one with `tools/release.sh`, which
builds it, signs it, commits it in the site repo, deploys, and mirrors the same three files, with `VERSION`, to a
GitHub Release.

### Reading from the mirror instead

Every release is published twice, from the same bytes with the same signature. `PLANETAI_GET` points a node at the
other copy — the site serves the files under `/get`, a GitHub Release serves them flat, and the same stub reads either:

```bash
PLANETAI_GET=https://github.com/fabcity/planetai-node/releases/download/<tag> \
  bash -c "$(curl -fsSL planetai.fab.city/install)"
```

`<tag>` is the release you want, `v0.72.1` for example. The first signed release is v0.61; v0.60 never shipped.

Useful when the site is unreachable, and useful when you would rather fetch from somewhere with a history anyone can
read. The signature is what makes the two copies the same artefact rather than two things that look alike.
