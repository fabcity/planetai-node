# Concepts

The words the rest of these pages use, each with what it means in the code at v0.72.1. When two of them
sound alike (`local` and `custody`, domain and issue, `kind` and `scale`, decided and acted) the difference
is the point. Most of them are about one question: which numbers belong to this place, and may be counted
for it.

## The node and its place

**Node.** The program at one address: two containers, one database, one API. It has a name (`NODE_NAME`,
lowercase with dashes), a position (`NODE_LAT`, `NODE_LON`), a time zone (`NODE_TZ`) and a city key
(`NODE_CITY`). Node #1 is `bayu-ungasan` in Kuta Selatan; node #2 is in Menorca.

**Kind** (`NODE_KIND`): `home`, `business`, `community` or `district`. What the node is for. It is not the
Index scale; the setup wizard sets `NODE_SCALE=city` when the kind is `district`.

**Scale** (`NODE_SCALE`): `community`, `city` or `region`, the Full Stack Metrics Framework's scales, of
which a node declares one. It is stamped on every push, and it names the core's own cell,
`Governance|<Scale>`. Metadata, not code.

**The H3 cell.** The node stands in a hexagon of the H3 grid at resolution 8, with an edge of about half a
kilometre: 497 m for node #1's cell, measured from the cell itself. The page prints it in the mono as a
fifteen-character id such as `8895a4c843fffff`, with its edge length beside it. Resolution 8 is coarser than
the three-decimal rounding of the node's position, so publishing the cell does not put the position back.

**The ladder.** The same place at eleven rungs, resolution 2 to 12, opening at 8. The wall and `planetai ui`
carry the same control under the same name. Each rung carries one cell's size and how many stations fall in
it. Rungs at resolution 6 and coarser may leave the machine (that is the finest a node may announce over
Reticulum); rungs finer than about 110 m are finer than the node says where it is, because `/health` rounds
its position to three decimals. The node computes the whole table and the page draws it.

**Issue.** What a household calls a quality of its place: `air`, `heat`, `land`, `coast`, with water, noise
and energy designed. Declared one file each in `app/issues/*.yml`, ordered by `NODE_ISSUES`, the keeper's
order, most important first. An issue is *sensed* when it has eyes on it and rules that can ask for
something, *context* when it informs and never asks. See [Issues](issues.md).

**Domain.** What a pack declares it is about. There are fewer issues than domains: weather feeds air and heat
but nobody asks how the weather is doing as a quality of their place; place is the ground; governance is the
loop and the Index; trust is the instruments.

## Sources and sensors

**Adapter.** One function returning `(sensors, readings)`. In `app/sources.py` for the sources that ship
with the core; in a pack's `adapter.py` for a code pack. The contract is on the [sensors](sensors.md) page.

**Sensor.** A row in `sensors`: `sensor_id`, `source`, `name`, `lat`, `lon`, `indoor`, `local`, `kind`,
`scale`, `cadence`, `meta`. The id is `<source>-<upstream id>` (`sc-19880`, `bad-pa-46949`), stable and
never reassigned.

**`local`.** Two facts at once: an adapter says whether a sensor is *yours*, and the node checks whether it
is *here*, within `LOCAL_RADIUS_M` (500 m) of the node. A kit on your account 1.2 km away is yours and is
not this node's measurement. A sensor with no coordinates that arrives over your own gateway stays local.

**`indoor`.** Carried on every sensor and honoured by every rule. An indoor sensor measures a room and never
enters an ambient average.

**`kind`.** How the number was produced: `sensor`, `portal`, `model`, `map`, `child`, `peer`, or
`facility`, a named place with a point and no number at all (a fab lab, from the `make` pack). `survey` is
reserved. Only `sensor` rows enter `stats`.

**`custody`.** A generated column: `kind = 'child' OR (local AND kind <> 'peer')`. The only thing a cell may
count. Custody splits geography from responsibility: a peer's station can be closer than your own kit and
still never be counted.

**Peer.** Another node whose numbers you may show and must never act on. A `kind='peer'` row reaches no
cell, no custody count, no aggregate, no alert, no report line.

**Channel role.** What a metric *is* for a given source, declared in `channels.yml` and written to
`channel_roles`: `ambient` (the air, water or land at a place, comparable between sensors there),
`enclosure` (the inside of the instrument's own box: a BME680 sealed in a radio reports the box, not the
street), `device_health` (battery, radio utilisation), `derived` (computed by the node), `index` (a vendor's
own composite, never pooled).

**Metric names.** Lowercase, no units in the name: `pm25 pm25_raw pm10 pm1 temp humidity pressure aqi
gas_resistance noise light eco2 tvoc co2 tvoc_index nox_index`. Units are fixed: µg/m³, °C, %, kPa. `pm25`
is the published value; if a correction was applied, the uncorrected figure sits beside it as `pm25_raw`.
Raw is never overwritten.

**The four distances.** Where a reading comes from, nearest first. The wire keys are `room` (local, indoor),
`yard` (local, outdoor), `ring` (somebody else's device near here) and `region` (a model, a portal). The page
prints them as house · street · ring · region; in Bahasa, rumah · jalan · sekitar · wilayah. In Spanish
they are casa · calle · alrededores · región. The keys stay as they are on the wire. A child node is a fifth
place that is not a column. A distance is custody, not scale: nothing maps a distance to an H3 resolution.

**Registry.** A pinned snapshot of `awesome-fabcity-data`, 238 entries at `1010aa0`, served at `/sources` and
listed by `planetai sources`. Most entries are things this place could measure; some are places to go and
designs to build. See the [CLI](cli.md).

## Rules, alerts, actions

**Rule.** SQL that returns rows, plus a message template with `{placeholders}` for the row's columns, a
`level` and a `cooldown_minutes`. No rules engine, no expression language: if Postgres cannot express the
condition, the condition is wrong. Core rules live in `config/rules.yml` and know no metric; a pack's
rules live in `packs/<id>/rules.yml`, namespaced `<pack>/<id>`. A rule's message ends with a line beginning
👉, its recommendation, and the dashboard's Decide card shows that line as "what this node suggests".

**Level.** `act`: something needs doing. `warn`: something changed. `info`: everything else.
`ALERT_LEVEL` is the floor for interrupting a person; below it an alert is still recorded, still on the
dashboard, still in the next report.

**Alert.** A row in `alerts` (`ts`, `rule_id`, `sensor_id`, `level`, `text`), whether or not it was sent.
Three paragraphs: what is happening, what it means, what to do. An act-level alert that no one has answered
is an *open alert*.

**Cooldown.** Per rule and sensor, enforced in SQL against `alerts`: a rule does not fire again for the same
sensor until its cooldown has passed.

**Action.** A row in `actions`: `alert_id`, `stage`, `actor`, `note`. Five stages. `acknowledged`: someone
saw it. `acted`: someone did the thing. `decided`: someone said what will be done, which moves nothing.
`measured`: the outcome was checked; the schema allows it and nothing writes it, and the funnel derives it
instead. `settings`: an audit row for a setting change, with no alert. `POST /actions` takes the first three.
`SPEC.md` calls this table "the Index's instrument, not an app feature": ρ is computed from it and nowhere
else.

**Decision.** A `decided` row, recorded from the dashboard's "What to do about it" card. It closes no alert, is
not in ρ and is not a stage in the funnel. With `DECISION_REQUIRED=1` (off by default) an `acted` with no
`decided` row before it is refused with HTTP 409.

**ρ (rho).** The share of act-level alerts in the last 30 days that had an `acknowledged` or `acted` action
within 24 hours, pooled with the children's events. The one number on the page that comes from a person.
See [ρ](rho.md).

**Funnel.** The same alerts counted four times: asked, acknowledged, acted, measured. `measured` is derived:
an act followed by 2,880 minutes (48 hours) of silence from the same rule on the same sensor, for rules the
node still runs. The funnel counts this node's own alerts only.

**Effect.** `GET /effect`, per rule over the whole record: how many acts, how many *cleared* (the same
derivation), and a recovery time in hours only for a rule that declares `watch: {metric, over}`.

**Report.** The node's one scheduled message: every `REPORT_EVERY` hours from `REPORT_ANCHOR`, local time,
six parts, under a hundred words, written by the node itself from SQL. See [The report](report.md).

## The page and its stages

**Stages.** The dashboard is read in the order the loop runs: observe, decide, act, measure. Every section
the page draws is registered under one of them.

**Digest.** Four sentences, one per stage, written by the node in English, Bahasa Indonesia and Spanish from
figures already in `GET /issues`.

**Headline.** The issue the lead is about. The highest state wins; where two issues are in the same state,
the one that moved most in the last three hours; an exact tie goes to the order in `NODE_ISSUES`. The page
prints that rule under the lead.

## Packs and cells

**Pack.** A folder in `packs/` with a `pack.yaml`. A *data pack* is YAML only: rules, cells, channel roles. A
*code pack* also carries an `adapter.py` and runs only when `PACKS_ALLOW_CODE=1`. The `make` pack, which names
the nearest fab lab, needs `MAKE_ENABLED=1` as well, because the directory it reads is not openly licensed.
See [Packs](packs.md).

**Cell.** One of the twenty cells of the Fab City Index, four pillars (Environmental, Economic, Social,
Governance) by five scales (Community, City, Region, Bioregion, Planet), written `Pillar|Scale`. A pack's
`cells.yml` computes a value with SQL that returns one `value`. The core adds `Governance|<Scale>`, which is
ρ and reads `partial` until five act-level alerts have been answered within a day.

**State.** Provenance, not confidence: `live` means measured here, in custody, in the last 24 hours;
`partial` means derived, modelled, or from a portal; `mock` means a placeholder. The core demotes `live` to
`partial` when there are too few hourly buckets or too few sensors, and aggregation never upgrades it.

**Contributor.** A rule with `contributes: report` and no message. Never sent; its first row lands in the
report bundle under the rule's id.

## Reaching the node

**`SHARE_LEVEL`.** What a request with no token may read: `off` (the dashboard shell, `/health`, `/presence`,
the daily export, and `/settings` reduced to the layout and the sharing level, nothing else) or `open` (the
whole read API, which is what a wall screen without a token needs). Two more rungs, `cell` and `means`, are
named and refused. See [Sharing](sharing.md).

**Tokens.** `ADMIN_TOKEN` unlocks every write and the agent surface. `BACKUP_TOKEN` is read-only, for a NAS
pulling dumps and the report bundle. `ACT_TOKEN` closes a loop, from a phone or from the dashboard's **I did
this**, and can read no secret. `AGGREGATE_TOKEN` is what this node demands from its children;
`PARENT_TOKEN` is what it presents to its parent. All travel as `Authorization: Bearer <token>`.

**Loopback.** A request from `127.0.0.1` inside the container (the node's own MCP tools, a shell in the
container) is trusted without a token. A browser on the host machine arrives from Docker's bridge and is
not loopback.

**Parent and child.** A child posts hourly means to its parent's `/aggregates` and alert timestamps to
`/events`; the parent stores the means under `<child>/<sensor_id>` with `kind='child'`. Raw never travels the
link. See [Federation](federation.md).

**The tailnet.** Tailscale, joined with `planetai mesh`. The node is reachable by its MagicDNS name,
`<name>.<your-tailnet>.ts.net`, from your devices with no open port. The answer to "how do I reach it from
outside" is always this, never a port forward.

## Provenance words on the page

`live`: measured by this node, in the house or on the street. `partial`: derived, a portal, the ring.
`model`: a model row. `cached`: a committed fixture replayed through the node's own engine. `stale`: the
last figures the node gave, once it has stopped answering. When a poll fails the lead's pill says `stale`
and the as-of stamp says "Read at HH:MM · the node has not answered for N min"; the wall's foot carries a
fixed `stale` label. `refused` is not a word but a page: what a reader without a token sees at
`SHARE_LEVEL=off`, with the node's own sentence explaining why. Provenance is ink only and square, never a coloured pill.

## Words

The dashboard and these pages use the programme page's words for what a person reads. The wire keys and
fields behind them do not change.

| The word a person reads | What it means | Wire key or field behind it | Retired word |
|---|---|---|---|
| alert | what the node sends a person when an act-level rule crosses its line | `alerts`, `asks` in `GET /issues` | ask |
| open alert | an act-level alert no one has answered yet | `open_asks` on each issue | open ask |
| ladder | the control that sets the H3 resolution, 2 to 12 | `geometry.grain_table`, the `res` query key | rail, grain rail, dial |
| rung | one step of the ladder: one H3 resolution | `res` on each `grain_table` row | stop, grain |
| resolution | how fine a cell is, as an H3 number | `res` | grain |
| house | local and indoors | `room` | room |
| street | local and outdoors: the household's own kit outside | `yard` | wall outside |
| ring | somebody else's public stations near here | `ring` | street |
| region | a model or a portal for this point | `region` | model |

These are the programme page's words, decided on 23 September 2026; `check_site.py`, in the programme
site's own `tools/`, fails when a retired word comes back on the programme page.

## Where this leads

These words are enough to read [How it works](how-it-works.md) end to end. To see them on a running node,
