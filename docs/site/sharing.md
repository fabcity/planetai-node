# Sharing and security

This page is the node's boundary: what a reader on the network may see without a token, which token
opens what, what leaves the machine and how coarse it is when it does, and whose code the node will
run. Reach is how a node joins a household's screens, a district and the Index without giving its
readings away. The repo's first refusal says it in one line: "No raw readings leave the instance that
recorded them."

The node's API is published on every interface of the machine, because the things that read it are on
the network: the NAS that pulls dumps, the phones and the wall screen in the house, Home Assistant, and an
agent's MCP client on the tailnet. Postgres is not: `db` binds `127.0.0.1:5432` only, and so do the IPFS
API and the Reticulum bridge's API. A token guards every write and every secret read. `SHARE_LEVEL` decides
what a reader with no token may see.

## `SHARE_LEVEL`

Two rungs in this version; `cell` and `means` are named in the help and refused until they exist.

| level | a request with no token, from another machine, may read |
|---|---|
| `off` (default) | 7 paths and the static files: `/` and `/ui` (the dashboard shell), `/health` with the centre of the node's resolution-8 cell, `/llms.txt`, `/settings` reduced to the layout and the sharing level, the daily CC BY 4.0 `/export`, `/presence`, and anything under `/static/`. Everything else is refused with a sentence naming the setting. |
| `open` | 31 paths and 4 prefixes: the `off` list, and `/stats`, `/sensors` and `/stats` (the household's own sensors at their cell's centre, the rest to three decimals, metadata cut to the provenance keys), `/observations`, `/alerts`, `/series`, `/sparks`, `/rho`, `/cells`, `/packs`, `/trust`, `/nearby`, `/forecast`, `/earth`, `/earth/change.png`, `/earth/year.png`, `/earth/frame.png`, `/report/latest`, `/readings`, `/reach`, `/shape`, `/effect`, `/history`, `/exports`, `/sources`, and anything under `/exports/`, `/issues` and `/sources/`. What a wall screen with no token needs. |

A refused request gets 403 and one of two sentences. For a path that `open` would answer:

```
{"error": "this node is set to SHARE_LEVEL=off, so /stats answers only this machine or a request carrying a token. Set SHARE_LEVEL to open in the dashboard's Set up view to let anything on your network read it."}
```

For a path no level opens, the last sentence is "No share level opens this one, so it always needs a
token from anywhere but the node itself." The dashboard draws the sentence on its refused page rather
than a blank.

`SHARE_LEVEL` is reach, not publishing: it says who on your network may read; it never sends anything
anywhere. Change it in Set up, with `planetai config set SHARE_LEVEL open`, or over MCP; it is live within 20
seconds.

To see the boundary move:

1. **Ask from another machine at `off`.** `curl http://<node>:8080/rho` answers 403 with
   `{"error": "this node is set to SHARE_LEVEL=off, so /rho answers only this machine or a request carrying a
   token. Set SHARE_LEVEL to open in the dashboard's Set up view to let anything on your network read it."}`.
   The node is answering and keeping ρ to itself.
2. **Open it.** On the node, `planetai config set SHARE_LEVEL open` prints `SHARE_LEVEL is now open, on this
   node, within 20 s`. After those 20 seconds the same `curl` returns the ρ document instead of the refusal.
   Every screen on your network can now read the node without a token; nothing has been sent anywhere.
3. **Ask for a path no level opens.** `curl http://<node>:8080/actions` still answers 403, and the sentence
   now ends "No share level opens this one, so it always needs a token from anywhere but the node itself."
   The ledger of what people did stays behind a token. `planetai config set SHARE_LEVEL off` closes the rest
   again.

`/sources` is on the `open` list on purpose: it is a copy of a public registry of public datasets, the
same entries on every node in a release, and it says nothing about this house.

> **Note.** `/shape` at `open` is the house's usual day: one mean per local hour, indoor against outdoor,
> over the whole record. It is what the page draws, and it is also a pattern of when the kitchen is in
> use. Weigh that before opening a node on a network you share.

## What needs a token at every level

`/place/geojson` (the shape of your building and what is around it), `/settings/raw`, `/backups` and
`/backups/<name>`, `/report/bundle`, `GET /aggregates`, `/briefing` and `GET /actions` are on neither
list. So is every write, and the whole of `/mcp` checks the admin token itself. Two writes pass the
sharing check because their path is on a list for reading, and their handler refuses them instead:
`POST /readings` at `open`, and `PUT /settings` at every level. Without the admin token, both are refused.

A request from the machine itself (loopback: `127.0.0.1` inside the container, which is the node's own MCP
tools and a shell in the container) is trusted without a token. A browser on the host is not loopback: it
arrives from Docker's bridge and is treated as a machine on the network.

`GET /actions` is the ledger of what people did about the alerts: which alert, which stage, who, and the
note they wrote. It is on no list because the note is the household's own words about its own house.
`planetai snapshot` blanks every note before it writes its file, for the same reason.

> **Careful.** `GET /actions` has no token check of its own. Any of the node's four tokens opens it, and
> so does `/place/geojson`: the admin token, the backup token on the NAS, the act token on a phone, and
> `AGGREGATE_TOKEN`, which every child node holds as its `PARENT_TOKEN`. Give a child's operator that
> token knowing it reads this node's notes and the plan of its building.

## The tokens

All travel as `Authorization: Bearer <token>`, compared in constant time. There is no query-string form.

| token | opens | where it comes from | give it to |
|---|---|---|---|
| `ADMIN_TOKEN` | every write and secret read: `PUT /settings`, `/settings/raw`, `POST /readings`, `/report/now`, `/test-alert`, the whole of `/mcp`; also what `BACKUP_TOKEN` and `ACT_TOKEN` open. It does not open `POST /aggregates` or `POST /events`, which take `AGGREGATE_TOKEN` only | generated by the installer; `planetai ui` prints it | yourself, your agent. Treat it like a password |
| `BACKUP_TOKEN` | read-only pulls: `/backups`, `/backups/<name>`, `/report/bundle`; cannot read `/settings/raw` | generated by `update.sh` when blank; `planetai ui` prints it (`planetai storage` says only whether it is set) | a NAS |
| `ACT_TOKEN` | `POST /actions` from off the machine: an act, an acknowledgement or a decision. It cannot read a secret or change a setting | `planetai ui` creates it | a phone, the dashboard's forms in a browser you trust, the Reticulum bridge |
| `AGGREGATE_TOKEN` | what this node demands on `POST /aggregates` and `POST /events`; unset, the node accepts no children | you set it | your children, as their `PARENT_TOKEN` |
| `PARENT_TOKEN` | sent with this node's hourly pushes to `PARENT_API_URL` | your parent's operator | the node itself |

Any of the four node tokens (admin, backup, act, aggregate) makes a request trusted by the sharing check,
at every level, so each of them reads the whole read API. Routes with a check of their own then apply it:
a backup token cannot change a setting, and an act token cannot fetch a dump. The routes without one are
in the Careful note above. The optional `X-Agent` header names the caller in the audit trail. The dashboard
keeps the token it was given in the browser's local storage and sends the admin token first, then the act
token.

`.env` is mode 600 and never committed. Dumps exclude the `settings` table, so a Telegram token saved from
Set up never travels to a NAS or a remote. The node never logs the Telegram URL, because the token is in it.

## What leaves the machine, and how coarse

| what | to whom | how exact |
|---|---|---|
| the node's position | `/health`, `/export`, and `/sensors` and `/stats` for the household's own sensors, for a reader without a token | the centre of the resolution-8 cell (about 500 m to an edge), since v0.73; this machine or a token gets three decimals |
| hourly means and alert timestamps | a parent node, hourly, if `PARENT_API_URL` is set | values and timestamps; never where, never text, never who |
| the daily export | anyone (CC BY 4.0) | your own sensors by role (`indoor-1`, `outdoor-2`), no raw rows, no chat ids |
| a presence announce | the Reticulum network, every half hour, only with `RETICULUM_PRESENCE=1` | the H3 cell rounded up to `RETICULUM_PRESENCE_RES` (3), with a floor of resolution 6 no setting can go under |
| the node's coordinates | Open-Meteo, for weather and the CAMS air model, with `OPENMETEO_ENABLED=1` | rounded to three decimals by the two core adapters |
| a request for the fab lab directory | gitlab.fabcloud.org (`MAKE_SOURCE=archive`) or api.fablabs.io (`live`), only with `MAKE_ENABLED=1` and `PACKS_ALLOW_CODE=1` | no coordinates: the whole directory comes down and the distances are worked out on the node |
| the square being looked at | a tile server, per tile, only with `MAP_TILES=on` | the tile's own square; `off` (the default) draws from the node's local copy of OpenStreetMap |
| the question you asked the bot | an online model, only if you gave it a key and changed `AGENT_PREFER` from its default, `private` | the question and the tool results the model asked for |
| raw readings | nobody | nothing |

`/forecast`, `/earth` and `/place/geojson` carry the node's exact coordinates and are
respectively open-only, open-only and token-only; read [the API](api.md) before putting `SHARE_LEVEL=open`
on a network you do not trust.

> **Gap in v0.72.1.** The first-start bootstrap and the `coast` and `forecast` packs send the node's
> full-precision coordinates to Open-Meteo; only the two core adapters round them.

## Signed updates

A node runs the code it is sent, so what it trusts is part of its boundary. Since v0.60 `install`, and
`planetai update` on a node installed from the tarball, download it, check its published SHA256, and then
check an `ssh-keygen -Y` signature against one key: principal `fabcity`, namespace `planetai-node`.
The public line is embedded in `install`, `update.sh` and `bin/planetai`, so a node can check an update
before it has one, and published in [tools/allowed_signers](../../tools/allowed_signers); `tests/test_release_consistency.sh` fails if the
four copies drift. The checksum proves the bytes arrived whole. The signature names who built them, with a
key that is not on the web server.

A download that does not verify is not installed, and the node says:

```
this download is not signed by the PLANETAI release key. Nothing was installed and nothing on this machine changed.
   Try again on a network you trust. If it says this twice, do not run it — tell us instead.
```

`planetai version` prints what this node trusts, and `planetai doctor` says whether the last update checked:

```
planetai-node v0.72.1  ·  a Fab City project  ·  <name> @ <city>
  updates signed by  fabcity  SHA256:1+MvZWJUBWisjY08E1KR77znXLs2lVWgVkh+Z++8IL4
```

Compare that fingerprint from a machine that is not the node. If they disagree, something replaced the
node's copy of the CLI, and the CLI is not the thing to ask. Every release is published twice from the same
bytes with the same signature, at `planetai.fab.city/node0/get` and as a GitHub Release, and
`PLANETAI_GET` points an install at the second. `PLANETAI_UNSIGNED=1` installs a tarball nobody signed,
with a red warning, and the doctor's signature row stays red until a signed update. How to report a problem
is in [SECURITY.md](../../SECURITY.md).

> **Gap in v0.72.1.** SECURITY.md still shows the fingerprint as "not yet issued". The key was issued on
> 19 September 2026, and `tools/allowed_signers` carries the fingerprint above.

## Reaching it from elsewhere

Tailscale. `planetai mesh` joins the tailnet under the node's name; the node is reachable by its MagicDNS
name, `<name>.<your-tailnet>.ts.net`, recorded as `MESH_NAME`, from your devices with no open port, and the
traffic that leaves the machine is encrypted by the tailnet. There is no TLS on the node itself: a node
reachable from outside the tailnet is what turns TLS from a checkbox into a requirement, and the answer to
reaching it from outside is not to. Headscale, self-hosted, is the recorded exit if a partner's governance
forbids a third-party coordinator. Never a port forward, ngrok or a public reverse proxy.

## A network the household does not trust

A loopback-only node (`SHARE_LEVEL=none`) is a retired piece with its trigger written: a node on a network
its household does not trust, *and* one that can afford to lose the NAS pull, the phones, Home Assistant
and MCP, all four of which read over the LAN. It would be a third level, opted into, never a default.

## Known debts

Containers run as root. The first-start bootstrap and the `coast` and `forecast` packs send full-precision
coordinates to Open-Meteo. Each is in the tracker
as work, not as a decision.

## Where this leads

With the boundary set, the node can take its place in a district: [Federation](federation.md) is what a
child sends its parent and what the parent refuses. To hand the node to an agent without handing it the
house, read [Agents](agents.md).
