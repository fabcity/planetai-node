# Packs
<!-- checked: v0.83.0 -->

A pack is how a place teaches its node what to watch and what to say about it. The core names no metric: what
`pm25` means, which line matters in this house, and the sentence a person should read at 9 pm are all written in a
pack. A data pack is SQL and words. A code pack also fetches, adding a source the core does not read.

There are two tiers:

| | core | wild |
|---|---|---|
| lives in | `packs/` in the node's repository, twenty-one of them | its author's own repository, or a folder in [fabcity/planetai-wild-packs](https://github.com/fabcity/planetai-wild-packs) |
| reaches a node | with every release | `planetai packs add` |
| checked by | the node's `make lint` and tests, on every commit | the wild-packs repository's CI, against the node's `main`, every week |
| kept by | the node's maintainers | its author |

What the core packs do is on [Packs that ship](packs-reference.md). This page is the contract as `app/packs.py`
reads it, how to add a wild pack, and one small data pack built step by step.

```
packs/<id>/
  pack.yaml     id, name, description, version, requires, domain, sources:, pip:, env:, secrets:, readouts:, sections:
  rules.yml     alerts: SQL that returns rows, one message per row; or a contribution to the report
  cells.yml     Index cells: SQL that returns one `value`
  channels.yml  what the pack's own metrics ARE: ambient, enclosure, device_health, derived, index, private
  adapter.py    a new source; its presence makes this a code pack
  hooks.py      on_readings and on_alert, what the pack does with what the node stores and sends; also code
  *.py          scripts, run with `planetai run <pack> <script>`
  README.md     where the thresholds came from, which place they were written for, what the pack does not know
```

## Add a wild pack

1. **Run `planetai packs add <id>`** with an id from the wild list, such as `posidonia`,
   or `planetai packs add <owner>/<repo>[/<folder>][@<ref>]` for any pack on GitHub. The node fetches the
   commit, pins it, and prints `● <id>: added, a data pack, from <source> at <commit>`. It warns when the pack is
   not on the list, or is listed and not yet reviewed, and when it is a code pack. Then it adds any settings the
   pack declares to `.env`, as `planetai packs install` does.
2. **Run `planetai restart`, then `planetai packs`.** The pack is under `wild:` with where it came from, the
   commit and the day it was added, and which of its scripts an agent may run. Run `planetai packs add` again to
   update it. To remove it, delete `packs/<id>` and restart.

A wild pack never replaces a core pack or a folder you put there by hand.

## How packs load

Every folder under `packs/` with a `pack.yaml` is a pack, in sorted order. `PACKS_ENABLED` filters that list:
blank means every pack, otherwise a comma list of ids. The loader reads the folders on every pass, and `packs/` is
mounted into the app container, so a folder you add is seen within a minute without a restart. A folder that
`planetai packs add` put there carries a `.wild` file beside its `pack.yaml`; any other folder counts as core.

A pack is a code pack if its folder has an `adapter.py`. The loader sets `kind` from that file and ignores the
`kind:` line in `pack.yaml`. An adapter runs with the node's privileges and network access, so it runs only with
`PACKS_ALLOW_CODE=1`: read it first. Without that setting the node logs `pack <id> ships code; set
PACKS_ALLOW_CODE=1 to run it (read <path> first)` and loads the pack's rules and cells anyway.

Because blank `PACKS_ENABLED` means every pack, a pack that must stay off by default has its own setting. `make`
waits for `MAKE_ENABLED=1`, because it reads a directory that is not openly licensed, and `fire` for
`FIRE_ENABLED=1`, for the bandwidth; both also need `PACKS_ALLOW_CODE=1`. `bali-air-dispatch` names `BAD_ENABLED` as
its `switch:`, and a core pack with a switch runs its adapter when the switch is `1`, without `PACKS_ALLOW_CODE`.

A `pack.yaml`, `rules.yml`, `cells.yml` or adapter that does not parse is logged and skipped, and the rest of the
node carries on. Every installed pack's `env:` keys, enabled or not, appear in Set up → Packs with their help text
and default. Rule ids are namespaced `<pack>/<id>`; the two core rules keep bare ids.

## Your first data pack

Five steps, each with something to check. The pack watches temperature, because most kits report it. If your
sensors do not, pick a metric they do report and change `temp` in both files.

**1. See what your node measures.** Run `planetai sensors`. The rows marked `yours` are the ones a rule written
with `local` will read. A pack teaches the node about readings it already holds; it adds no sensor.

**2. Make the folder.** In the node's directory (`~/planetai` on an installed node), create
`packs/my-room/pack.yaml`:

```yaml
id: my-room
name: My room
description: How warm the rooms this node measures have been, as one alert a day and one Index cell.
version: 0.1.0
requires: { node: ">=0.72.0" }
domain: heat
```

Within a minute `planetai packs` lists it under `loaded now:`, in `core:`, as `my-room          data  How warm the
rooms…`. If it does not appear and `PACKS_ENABLED` is not blank, add `my-room` to that list. `domain: heat` puts
the pack's alerts under the heat issue on the dashboard.

**3. Teach it one thing to say.** Create `packs/my-room/rules.yml`. The line is set low on purpose, so it fires now
and you see the whole path; step 5 moves it.

```yaml
- id: room_warm
  level: info
  cooldown_minutes: 1440
  sql: |
    SELECT sensor_id, name, mean_1h FROM stats
    WHERE local AND metric = 'temp' AND mean_1h > 20
  message:
    en: "🌡️ {name} has averaged {mean_1h:.1f} °C over the last hour.\n\n👉 Open a window on the shaded side, or switch on a fan."
    id: "🌡️ Suhu rata-rata {name} {mean_1h:.1f} °C selama satu jam terakhir.\n\n👉 Buka jendela di sisi yang teduh, atau nyalakan kipas angin."
    es: "🌡️ {name} ha promediado {mean_1h:.1f} °C durante la última hora.\n\n👉 Abre una ventana del lado de la sombra, o enciende un ventilador."
```

Rules run every 60 seconds. Run `planetai status`: under `alerts` it prints the time and the start of your
message, with your sensor's name and its last hour filled in. That row is in the `alerts` table under the id
`my-room/room_warm`, and it will not repeat for that sensor for 1440 minutes. At the default `ALERT_LEVEL=act` an
`info` alert is recorded, shown on the dashboard and carried by the next report, and interrupts nobody (see
[Alerts](alerts.md)). If nothing appears, `planetai logs | grep my-room` shows `rule my-room/room_warm failed: …`
with Postgres's reason.

**4. Say which Index cell it becomes.** Create `packs/my-room/cells.yml`:

```yaml
- cell: "Environmental|Community"
  unit: "°C (24h mean, sensors in this node's custody)"
  state: live
  min_buckets: 12
  notes: "my-room: every temperature channel in custody, hourly means, last 24 h"
  sql: |
    SELECT avg(mean) AS value FROM readings_1h r JOIN sensors s USING (sensor_id)
    WHERE s.custody AND r.metric = 'temp' AND r.bucket > now() - interval '24 hours'
```

Run `planetai cells`. A new `Environmental|Community` row carries your value, its state and your unit.
`planetai cells --json` shows the full row, with `source: "planetai-node ·
pack:my-room"` and a note ending in `<have>/12 hourly buckets`. The state reads `partial` until the node holds 12
hourly buckets from sensors in its custody and enough of those sensors report (see [Cells](#cells)). A row like
this, a mean with its provenance, is the only form in which a place's measurements reach the Fab City Index (see
[Federation](federation.md)).

**5. Move the line to your place.** Change `20` in the SQL to the temperature this room should not pass, and say in
a `README.md` where that number came from. To make it an alert that asks for something, set `level: act`, keep
`cooldown_minutes` at or under 2880, add `watch: {metric: temp, over: <the same number>}` so the node can time how
long an action took to work, and add `{line}` to the message so it names the line. The cooldown still counts from
the `info` alert of step 3, so the first `act` alert comes once those 1440 minutes have passed with the room still
over the line. Then a 🔴 message reaches Telegram if it is connected, the heat issue's state is `act`, and the
lead's last line counts the alert (`1 alert open · in Decide` when it is the only one). What a person records
against it counts in [ρ](rho.md).

On a checkout of the repository, `python3 tools/check_rules.py` (it needs `sqlglot`) parses every pack against
`init.sql` and prints `55 rules and cells check out against init.sql`, two more with your folder added. A
`{placeholder}` the SQL does not return is refused here and named; on a running node the same mistake sends the
raw template, braces and all.

## Fields in pack.yaml

| field | used for |
|---|---|
| `id` | the pack's name; defaults to the folder |
| `name` | what a person calls it; the Packs card in Set up shows it, and falls back to `id` |
| `description` | shown by `planetai packs` and `GET /packs` |
| `kind: data` | `data` or `code`; overwritten from the presence of `adapter.py`, so it only documents the intent |
| `version: 0.1.0` | the pack's own version, returned in `GET /packs`; nothing compares it |
| `requires: {node: ">=0.76"}` | the node versions the pack loads on. A node outside the range does not load it, says so once in its log, and lists it under "not loaded" in `planetai packs`. Declare at least `>=0.76` for `readouts` or `sections`, which an older node ignores without a word |
| `domain` | which dashboard issue the pack feeds (`air`, `heat`, `land`, `coast`, …). A cross-domain pack's rules are claimed one by one in `app/issues/*.yml`. A pack that reaches no issue and is not one of the domains outside them (`weather`, `place`, `governance`, `repair`) fails `tests/test_issues.py`. See [Issues](issues.md) |
| `sources: [environmental/community/bali-air-dispatch]` | the registry ids of the data sources it reads. `make lint` runs `tools/check_registry.py`, which fails and names any id that is not an entry in the registry the node carries. See [The source registry](sources.md) |
| `pip: [earthengine-api]` | libraries `planetai packs install` builds into the image, once, as the union of every pack folder's list |
| `env: ["# comment", "KEY=default"]` | settings `planetai packs install` appends to `.env` under a dated marker when the key is absent; a comment line travels with the key under it. No space after `=` |
| `secrets: [CAMERA_WYZE_BRIDGE_TOKEN]` | which of its `env` keys are secrets. Set up and the agent's `settings_get` mask them once saved, like the node's own tokens; a key not listed here is shown to anyone holding the admin token |
| `switch: BAD_ENABLED` | the pack's own on-switch, one of its `env` keys. A core pack that names one runs its `adapter.py` when the switch is `1`, without `PACKS_ALLOW_CODE`; a wild pack still needs the flag. Set up draws any pack's `…_ENABLED` key as a switch |
| `stations: {source, prefix, radius, box, url, attribution}` | a network of other people's stations the pack reads, for "Air stations nearby", `GET /nearby` and the ring on the map. `box` (south, north, west, east) is where the network has stations; `radius` names the key that sets how far the ring reaches |
| `agent_scripts: [verify]` | which of a wild pack's scripts a connected agent may run through `run_pack_script`. Leave it out and none do; a core pack's are all open, and `planetai run` runs every script either way. No agent can run `adapter.py` as a script |
| `readouts: {air: [ … ]}` | numbers the pack adds to an issue, in the shape an issue file uses; shown in Figures, and in the sentence of a context issue. It adds and never replaces. See [PACKS.md](https://github.com/fabcity/planetai-node/blob/main/docs/PACKS.md#readouts-on-an-issue) |
| `sections: [ … ]` | a band the pack declares on the dashboard as data, drawn with the page's own readout cards. See [A dashboard section](#a-dashboard-section) |
| `needs: [api.bmkg.go.id]` | hosts the pack reaches, for people to read |
| `author`, `attribution` | who wrote it and answers for it; the licence line a source asks to be credited with |
| `metrics: [pm25, pm10]`, `scales: [community, city]` | what it measures and at which scales, for a reader choosing a pack. No code reads either: the channels a pack really produces are in `channels.yml`, and the cells it fills in `cells.yml` |
| `thresholds: US EPA / WHO 2021` | one line on where its numbers come from; the README says the rest |

## Rules

YAML only. A rule's SQL runs every 60 seconds as the read-only role `planetai_ro`: every table but `settings`, and
no writes, so a rule cannot read a token into an alert or change a row. Postgres does the maths, `corr()`
included. The first rule in `packs/air-quality/rules.yml`, with its message shortened:

```yaml
- id: indoor_pm25_high
  level: act
  cooldown_minutes: 120
  watch: {metric: pm25, over: 35.5}
  sql: |
    SELECT sensor_id, name, mean_15m FROM stats
    WHERE local AND indoor AND metric = 'pm25' AND mean_15m > 35.5
  message:
    en: "😷 The air inside at {name} is unhealthy right now … {line} µg/m³.\n\n…\n\nRun the purifier if you have one. …"
    id: "😷 Udara di dalam {name} sedang tidak sehat … {line} µg/m³.\n\n…\n\nNyalakan pembersih udara kalau ada. …"
    es: "😷 El aire dentro de {name} no es saludable ahora mismo … {line} µg/m³.\n\n…\n\nEnciende el purificador si tienes uno. …"
```

| field | required | meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | yes | becomes `<pack>/<id>` |
| `sql` | yes | one `SELECT`; every returned row is a candidate alert. A `sensor_id` column keys the cooldown; without one the row is the node's |
| `level` | no (`info`) | `info`, `warn` or `act`; see [Alerts](alerts.md#levels) |
| `cooldown_minutes` | no (60) | per rule and sensor, checked against `alerts`. An `act` rule may not exceed 2880, the window after which the node counts a silent rule as cleared; `tests/test_share.py` fails a slower one |
| `long_cooldown_ok: true` | when cooldown > 20160 | tells the lint a cooldown over a fortnight is deliberate |
| `watch: {metric, over}` | no | the indicator and the line the rule is about, so `GET /effect` can time how long after an action the reading came back under it, and `{line}` in the message prints it. The lint fails if the metric or the number is missing from the SQL. Leave it out where the rule fires on a relation between two readings |
| `message` | unless `contributes` | a string or `{en, id, es}`, filled with the row by `str.format`; a `None` renders as a dash |
| `contributes: report` | instead of `message` | never sent; the first row lands in the report bundle under the rule's id |
| `kind`, `issue` | no | makes the rule the event engine's. `kind` is `ahead`, `unusual`, `spike`, `sustained` or `danger`; `issue` (default `heat` for the `heat` pack, `air` for `air-quality`, else the pack's id) is the story its rows fold into. Every row must carry `value`, `line` and, optionally, `over` (false for a row inside the margin, which keeps an open event open and never opens one). Under `ALERT_ENGINE=rules` the rule is skipped; under `shadow` and `events` it writes no `alerts` row. See [Alerts](alerts.md#the-event-engine) |

The node picks `message[ALERT_LOCALE]` and falls back to `en`. Every shipped rule carries all three languages, and
every `{placeholder}` in every language must be a column the top-level `SELECT` returns, or `{line}` with a
`watch:`.

End a message with a paragraph that starts with 👉 and says what a person does; the classic dashboard's Decide
card shows it as "what this node suggests" (see [Alerts](alerts.md#what-an-alert-says)). A rule that treats indoor
sensors as ambient will not be merged, which is what `NOT s.indoor` is for.

`make lint` runs `tools/check_rules.py` (with sqlglot) over every rule and cell. Besides the limits in the table, it
refuses unknown tables and columns, a cell without a `value`, and a rule with both a message and a contribution or
with neither, which could fire and reach nobody.

What a rule may read:

| table or view | what it holds |
|---|---|
| `stats` | `sensor_id, metric, indoor, local, kind, scale, lat, lon, name, last, last_ts, silent_minutes, mean_15m, mean_1h, mean_24h`: the last 24 hours, sensors only |
| `readings_1h` | hourly `mean, min, max, n` over all history; a filter on `bucket` reads only the hours it asks for |
| `recent_15m` | quarter-hour means of the last 24 hours, with `apparent` |
| `usual_by_hour` | each room's own median, p75 and p90 for each local hour, from the fourteen complete days before today |
| `observations` | the latest value per slow source |
| `readings`, `sensors`, `channel_roles` | the raw tables |

The node's own position and time zone are Postgres settings: `current_setting('planetai.lat')`,
`current_setting('planetai.lon')`, `current_setting('TimeZone')`. `NODE_TZ` is the session time zone, so
`date_trunc('day', ts)` means the household's day.

A contributor has no level, no cooldown and no message:

```yaml
- id: digest
  contributes: report
  sql: SELECT round(avg(mean_1h)) AS inside FROM stats WHERE local AND indoor AND metric='pm25'
```

## Cells

```yaml
- cell: "Environmental|Community"
  unit: "µg/m³ PM2.5 (24h mean, sensors in this node's custody)"
  state: live                # live | partial | mock
  min_buckets: 12
  notes: "your own outdoor and indoor kits, hourly means, last 24 h"
  sql: SELECT avg(mean) AS value FROM readings_1h r JOIN sensors s USING (sensor_id)
       WHERE s.custody AND r.metric='pm25' AND r.bucket > now() - interval '24 hours'
```

`state` is provenance. `live` means measured here; `partial` means derived, from a model or a portal, whatever its
quality. Never claim `live` for a model. The core demotes `live` to `partial` when the in-custody hourly buckets in
24 hours are fewer than `min_buckets`, or when too few in-custody sensors report (two where the node has children
or is above community scale, one otherwise), and appends `have/need hourly buckets` to the note. A `NULL` value
leaves the cell out, so absent is never zero. The cell's source is recorded as `planetai-node · pack:<id>`, and the
core adds one cell of its own, `Governance|<Scale>` = [ρ](rho.md). Each row also carries `registered`, `reviewed`,
`candidate`, `capable` and `adapter` from [the source registry](sources.md), where `registered` means `reviewed`.

## Channel roles

A pack that adds a metric says what it is, keyed on `(source, metric)`:

```yaml
- { source: forecast-om, metric: fc_wind_speed, role: derived, comparable: false, unit: "km/h" }
```

Roles are `ambient`, `enclosure`, `device_health`, `derived`, `index` and `private`, defined on the
[sensors](sensors.md) page. The core's `config/channels.yml` is read first; a pack may not redeclare a pair the core
already claimed, and the duplicate is logged and dropped. A pack that adds no metric ships `channels.yml` as `[]`
to say so, as `trust` does.

## Code packs: adapters

`adapter.py` has `fetch(hc) -> (sensors, readings)`, the same contract as `app/sources.py`, and runs only as
described under [How packs load](#how-packs-load). Dependencies and settings go in `pack.yaml`. `planetai packs`
lists what is loaded and says when a dependency or a setting is missing, and `planetai packs install` adds the
missing `env:` keys to `.env` and rebuilds the image once with every pack's `pip:` list. A pack that needs a key or
a service must log once and return nothing when it is missing. `packs/earth-engine` is the worked example: a
dependency, a credential, several remote datasets, and it idles until configured. `packs/make` is a code pack that
stores places rather than numbers.

## Scripts

Things you ask for rather than things that run on a schedule:

```bash
planetai run                          # lists every script with its first line
planetai run earth change --all       # the land change for every consecutive year pair this node has cached
planetai run nearby stations          # every station in the ring, with the reason for each exclusion
planetai run place gaps               # a mapping brief: what is undrawn within the kilometre
planetai run season window            # every paired station, its week, its baseline, the step
```

They run inside the app container, where the dependencies are, with `PACK_OUT=/app/out`. `out/` is the one writable
path, and what they write there is yours to send anywhere. Every `*.py` in a pack except `adapter.py` is listed, so
a helper module shows up too (`place/satellite.py` does).

## A dashboard section

Any pack, wild or core, can declare a section in its `pack.yaml`, as data. The node reads each readout's latest
row and serves the section in `GET /issues` under `sections` (a core pack's section only once a row of it exists).
The page draws it as a band in its stage on Now, with the pack's name beside the title, using its own readout cards
and no code from the pack:

```yaml
sections:
  - id: sg-air                          # unique on the page: lowercase letters, digits and hyphens
    stage: observe                      # observe · decide · act · measure
    title: { en: Singapore air, from NEA, id: Udara Singapura, dari NEA, es: Aire de Singapur, de NEA }
    order: 40                           # optional, default 50
    wall: true                          # optional: each reading is also a column on the wall
    readouts:
      - { metric: psi, sensor_id: nea-psi, unit: PSI, dp: 0, label: { en: NEA PSI, id: PSI NEA, es: PSI de NEA } }
```

A declared section draws readout cards only. A stack, a series or a row needs script, and script on this page is
for core packs only: it reads the same browser storage the admin token is kept in, so a pack's own script would hold
admin rights on every node that installed it. A core section registers one object with the page contract:

```js
window.PAI.register({
  id: 'meshtastic',            // required, unique; the band's DOM id
  pack: 'meshtastic',          // required
  stage: 'observe',            // required: observe · decide · act · measure
  title: 'The mesh in this house',  // required
  render(ctx) { … },           // render or lead is required; captions belong here, explanations do not
  order: 41,                   // within the stage, lower first (default 50)
  level: 'advanced',           // default; 'simple' keeps it in simple mode on Historical and Network (simple on Now draws no sections)
  needs: ['H3.radio.mesh'],    // dotted paths off window; absent → one honest line, never a blank
  learn: ['states'],           // learn marks this section carries
  controls(ctx) { … },         // optional control strip
  wall(ctx) { … },             // what this section contributes to the wall
  notes(ctx) { … },            // [{ id, label, text }]: the explanations, gathered at the foot of the page
});
```

A section may not invent a fifth card kind (readout · stack · series · row), colour a state by hue, print a numeral
without `data-num`, or put its explanation in its body. A scripted section lives inline in
`app/static/dashboard.js`, because the node serves its static files from a fixed allowlist, so it comes with the
pack's promotion to core. The page itself is on [Dashboard](dashboard.md).

## Sharing one

Do not fork the node to write a pack for your city. Make a repository that is the pack folder, develop it in
`packs/<id>` on your own node, and run `python3 tools/check_rules.py` from the node's folder. Say in the README where
the thresholds come from and which place you wrote for: thresholds for Kuta Selatan are not thresholds for
Barcelona. A source the pack reads has to be an entry in the registry first, so `sources:` can name it.

To let other nodes find it, add one entry to `packs.json` in
[fabcity/planetai-wild-packs](https://github.com/fabcity/planetai-wild-packs) by pull request. Its README lists the
fields, anyone may be listed, and an entry is marked `listed` until a maintainer has read it (for a code pack, its
adapter) and marks it `reviewed`. Any node then installs it with `planetai packs add <owner>/<repo>`. The same
repository can host the folder for you if you would rather not keep a repository of your own.

A pull request to the node's repository is for promotion to core. A reviewer asks that the pack is useful beyond
the place it was written for, or is the reference for a pilot city; that its data is openly licensed and its README
says under which licence; that it has offline tests registered in `tests/all`; and that a maintainer agrees to keep
it. The issue a new domain declares is explained on [Issues](issues.md).

## Packs nobody has written yet

Each of these would fill a gap the node has today. Take the one whose sensor you own and whose decision you face.

| pack | what it would watch | Index cell | what it needs |
|---|---|---|---|
| classroom | CO₂ over 1,200 ppm for 20 minutes: open the windows | `Social\|Community` | a CO₂ sensor the node reads (the AirGradient adapter is written and not yet polled, see [Sensors](sensors.md)) |
| outage | grid up and down, as outage hours | `Economic\|Community` | a smart plug on the broker |
| water | turbidity, TDS and tank level: is the well safe, will the tank last to the rain | `Environmental\|Community` | a DIY probe on an ESP32, over MQTT |
| lab machines | hours run, jobs, material in and out | `Economic\|Community` | a fab lab's job log, from Fabman or a CSV |
| open-data portals | the Socrata and ArcGIS portals of cities such as Barcelona and Boston | `Governance\|Region` | nothing but the portal |
| noise | school-hours rules on sound levels | | a Smart Citizen kit, which already reports noise |

Smaller ones, an afternoon each: tides, pollen, procurement latency from public tender data (TED, ChileCompra,
LKPP), and a pack that is only messages translated into another language.

## Where this leads

A pack reads what the node already holds. When the thing your place needs measured is not held yet, the next page
is [the source registry](sources.md): what the network has filed as measurable at each pillar and scale, which of it
any code reads, and which is waiting for somebody to write the adapter.
