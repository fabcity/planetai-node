# Wall mode

A screen on a wall that nobody is standing at. With the wall, the node is read by people walking past: a
household sees one number, one sentence and whether the loop closed, and a lab sees which cells around it
have a station and which do not. It observes and measures. It asks nothing, because an answer belongs where
somebody can write one.

```
http://<node>:8080/#wall
```

`planetai ui` prints the same thing: "On a wall screen: add #wall — the dark register, turns its own dial;
needs SHARE_LEVEL=open".

## Putting one up

1. **Let the house read the node.** A wall screen carries no token, so it needs `SHARE_LEVEL=open`:
   `planetai config set SHARE_LEVEL open`, or Set up → Node. At `off` the wall draws the refused page in the
   dark register ("This node is not sharing its readings with the network" and the node's own sentence),
   because a black screen would be the node lying about being broken.
2. **Open `#wall` on the screen.** You should see the top bar, the grid of nineteen cells on the left and
   the headline issue on the right, all inside one viewport, in the dark register. The grid is the node's
   own cell and the cells around it, each holding what is read there; an empty cell means no station the
   node hears is reading there.
3. **Check the foot.** The as-of line should read "As of" and a time. If it reads "Read at … · the node has
   not answered for N min", the screen is up and the node is not answering it.
4. **Leave it.** The top bar says "the dial turns every 8 s" and the foot "the dial turns by itself every
   8 s". Watch one turn: the filled stop moves on and the grid re-draws at the next resolution, so the
   stations gather into fewer cells at a coarse stop and spread out at a fine one. The page re-reads the
   node on its own `POLL_SECONDS`, as every view does. If the bar says "the dial stands still", the screen
   has reduced motion on and the dial turns only when a stop is pressed.

## The register

The wall is always dark, whatever register the rest of the page is in: `#wall` sets `data-theme="dark"` on
the page. Ink ground, paper type, and the lifted blue `#7FA5E8` for cells, because Fab Blue is 1.72:1 on ink.
It is laid out to fill one viewport (`min-height: 100vh`), so nothing a passer-by needs sits below the fold.

## The top bar

The bar answers the questions asked before any reading is read. From the left: a **back** button, drawn first
so it is first in keyboard order; up to four variable chips; the node's name, its city, `#wall`, a share
level (always `off` in v0.72.1, because `/health` carries no share level) and how often the dial turns ("the dial turns every 8 s", or "the dial stands still" under reduced
motion); and at the right what the numbers are: the variable, its unit, and `15-min means`.

The chips offer only metrics at least one station on this node carries. The one being shown is always first,
then the node's own order, four at most; a "+N more" link opens `?vars=all`. `?var=` picks one directly
(default `pm25`). A metric no station reads is not offered, because an empty field would claim a measurement
the node does not make.

## The wall is the grid

Nineteen H3 cells (the node's own and two rings around it) at the current resolution, each holding what is
read in it, with no map under them. One station in a cell: its 15-minute mean of the variable and its name.
Several: how many, and the range low to high. The node's own cell: each of its own stations' values. An
empty cell is drawn and left empty.

## The dial turns itself

The dial's stops are the resolutions the node's grain table knows, drawn as hexagons: the current stop
filled ink, a stop coarse enough that the cell may leave the machine filled in the cells blue at 0.16, a stop
finer than the published resolution dashed. Every eight seconds the dial steps to the next stop and the grid
re-draws; at the finest it wraps to the coarsest. There is no tween: there is no place between 7 and 8, so
nothing morphs. Pressing a stop or a cell, or an arrow key, holds the dial for thirty seconds and pauses the
clock bar. Under `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` nothing turns.

## The right column

The headline issue: kicker, sentence, why and the ask. Under the ask, "Answer on Telegram, not here." The
wall shows an ask and never the button that answers it. Then the dial, with its key under it ("current stop
filled ink · may-leave stops filled `--cells` at .16 · finer than published, dashed"), the grain counts ("Cells
with a station" of 19 drawn; "In this node's cell" of n stations; "Of them, its own") and the ρ row. Under the
field, the fragments each section contributes through its `wall()`, in one row: the first five, then "+N more
in Now".

The ρ row is the one object that is not a typed number: the rings are counted, never sized. More signs, never
a bigger sign. When there are too many asks to count at three metres the unit changes instead: one ring per
ask up to 40, one per 10 up to 400, then one per 100, and the caption under the row names the unit and gives
the exact counts.

## The foot

The as-of time, the version stamp, the word `stale` in bold ink, and the motion caption. The bold word is a
fixed label in v0.72.1. The as-of time beside it does judge: when the page's last poll got no answer it reads
"Read at … · the node has not answered for N min".

If the wall throws while it draws, the screen says "The wall did not render:" and the reason, rather than
going black.

## Where this leads

The wall only shows the ask. The answer is given on Telegram, over the radio or on the dashboard, and all of
them write the same row in `actions`: see [Channels](channels.md) and [the dashboard](dashboard.md). What the
ρ row counts is [ρ](rho.md).
