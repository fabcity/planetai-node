# Database schema
<!-- checked: v0.77 -->

Everything the node knows sits in one Postgres database, `planetai`, on the machine itself. A pack's rules and cells are SQL written against the tables and views on this page, and a person debugging a node at 9 pm reads the same ones with `psql`. The raw readings live in `readings` and stay here: "No raw readings leave the instance that recorded them" (ARCHITECTURE.md). What goes up to a parent is `readings_1h`, the hourly means, and the timestamps in `alerts` and `actions`.

`init.sql` is the whole schema, written to be run twice: `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS`, `ALTER TABLE … ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS`, and `DROP VIEW` then `CREATE VIEW`. Postgres runs it on its own only when the data volume is first created, so `update.sh` applies the same file to the existing database on every update, and `planetai restore` applies it after a restore. Schema changes are additive by rule (SPEC §5): no dropped columns, no renames, no destructive migrations. That is what makes rollback a `git checkout <tag>` and a restart rather than a restore. The one exception so far is `events.cleared_at`, a column nothing ever wrote, dropped in 0.51. `schema_version` records where a node is, and `/health` reports it.

This page was read from `init.sql` at v0.77: 12 tables, 4 views, 1 materialized view and 1 role.

## Tables

### `sensors`

One row per thing that produces readings, and per place the node was told about.

| column | type | meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `sensor_id` | text, primary key | `<source>-<upstream id>`: `sc-19880`, `bad-pa-46949`; a child's as `<child>/<sensor_id>`; a fab lab's as `lab-<slug>`. Never reassigned |
| `source` | text | the adapter: `smartcitizen`, `baliairdispatch`, `airgradient`, `open-meteo`, `open-meteo-cams`, `nasa-power`, `ckan`, `meshtastic`, `child`, `contributor`, or a pack's (`fablabs-io` for `make`) |
| `name` | text | the place, as the person named it |
| `lat`, `lon` | double | position; rounded before it leaves for a reader without a token |
| `indoor` | bool | measures a room; never in an ambient average |
| `local` | bool | the person's own **and** within `LOCAL_RADIUS_M` of the node |
| `kind` | text | `sensor` · `portal` · `model` · `survey` · `child` · `peer` · `facility`, as `init.sql` lists them; the place pack also writes `map` |
| `scale` | text | `community` · `city` · `region` · `bioregion` · `planet` |
| `cadence` | text | ISO 8601 duration: `PT5M`, `PT1H`, `P1D`, `P30D`, `P1Y` |
| `meta` | jsonb | free-form. An untrusted reader of `/sensors` gets only `licence`, `attribution`, `model`, `dataset`, `network`, `note`, `corrected`, and for a `facility` row ten more keys that describe the lab |
| `custody` | bool, generated | `kind = 'child' OR (local AND kind <> 'peer')`. The only thing a cell may count |

In v0.77 no adapter writes `survey` or `peer`; both are named in `init.sql` and `peer` is in the `custody` expression.

**A facility has no readings.** `kind = 'facility'` is a place with a name and a point, and the `make` pack is what writes it. When `MAKE_ENABLED=1`, the pack reads the Fab Lab Network directory and stores each active lab within `MAKE_RADIUS_KM` (default 50) as one `sensors` row: `sensor_id` `lab-<slug>`, `source` `fablabs-io`, `local` false, `scale` `community`, `cadence` `P30D`. Its `meta` holds `slug`, `capabilities`, `kind_name`, `city`, `country_code`, `distance_km`, `url`, `registry_slug`, `snapshot`, `fetched` and `attribution`. No `readings` row is ever written for it, so it is in neither `stats` nor `observations`; `/issues` reads the rows straight from `sensors`. Because `local` is false, `custody` is false, and a fab lab can never make an Index cell say `live`. The pack fetches again only when the newest `meta.fetched` is older than `MAKE_REFRESH_DAYS` (default 30).

### `readings`

| column | type | |
|---|---|---|
| `ts` | timestamptz | a UTC instant |
| `sensor_id` | text → `sensors` | |
| `metric` | text | lowercase, no unit in the name |
| `value` | double | |

Unique on `(sensor_id, metric, ts)`, so polling twice is harmless; indexed `(sensor_id, metric, ts desc)`.

### `alerts`

| column | | |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | bigserial | the number a person answers |
| `ts` | timestamptz | when the rule fired |
| `rule_id` | text | `<pack>/<id>`, or a bare core id |
| `sensor_id` | text | the row's sensor, or `node` |
| `level` | text | `info` · `warn` · `act` |
| `text` | text | the filled message |
| `event_id` | bigint → `alert_events.id` | the event the alert fed. Null on every row in v0.77: nothing writes it yet |

Indexed `(rule_id, sensor_id, ts desc)` for the cooldown check. There is no notion of an alert clearing, only of cooldowns; an [alert event](#alert-events) is the row that opens and clears.

### `actions`

The ρ instrument: what happened after an alert, one row per answer.

| column | | |
|---|---|---|
| `ts` | timestamptz | |
| `alert_id` | bigint → `alerts.id` | null for `settings` rows and for the answers to an alert event |
| `event_id` | bigint → `alert_events.id` | set only on an answer to an event, from `POST /actions` with an `event_id`; null on every other row |
| `stage` | text | checked: `acknowledged` · `acted` · `measured` · `settings` · `decided` · `dismissed` |
| `actor` | text | who: the name typed on the dashboard, the login name from `planetai act`, `lxmf:<hash>` from the radio bridge, an agent's name, or the `X-Agent` of a settings change |
| `note` | text | in the person's words |

The six stages do different things, and two of them are never posted by a person.

| stage | Written by | What it moves |
|---|---|---|
| `acknowledged` | `POST /actions` | ρ, and `/alerts.acted_at` |
| `acted` | `POST /actions` | ρ, `acted_at`, and closes the alert |
| `decided` | `POST /actions` | Nothing. It is a record that somebody said what they would do: not in ρ, not a funnel stage, closes no alert |
| `dismissed` | `POST /actions` with an `event_id`, never with an `alert_id` | Nothing. It is *Doesn't fit*, said of an alert event's advice. Every ρ, funnel and effect query joins `actions` to `alerts` on `alert_id`, so an event's three answers (`acknowledged`, `acted`, `dismissed`) are in none of them |
| `measured` | Nothing, in v0.77 | `POST /actions` refuses it. The node derives `measured` instead, from an `acted` alert whose rule stayed silent on the same sensor for 2880 minutes; see [rho](rho.md). A `measured` row already in the table still counts |
| `settings` | `PUT /settings`, `planetai config set`, the `settings_set` tool | Nothing in ρ; it records who changed which keys |

With `DECISION_REQUIRED=1`, `POST /actions` refuses an `acted` row for an alert that has no `decided` row yet. The table itself does not enforce that.

### `reports`

| column | | |
|---|---|---|
| `id`, `ts` | | |
| `due_local` | timestamptz | the local due hour; the row is the scheduler's lock. Null for `POST /report/now` |
| `window_hours` | int | |
| `depth` | text | `sheet` on every row in v0.77; `brief` · `standard` · `deep` reserved |
| `rung` | text | `node` on every row in v0.77; `local` · `remote` · `online` reserved |
| `text` | text | what was sent. Both writers put the sheet here in v0.77, so it equals `sheet` |
| `sheet` | text | the node's own six parts, always |
| `sent`, `held_quiet` | bool | a report due in quiet hours is written with `sent` false and `held_quiet` true, and folded into the next |
| `fallback_reason` | text | why `text` is the sheet and not a model's. Nothing writes it in v0.77 |
| `cells` | jsonb | the Index cells at the time of the report |

### `events`

ρ from below: one row per child alert, pushed hourly by children to `POST /events`.

| column | | |
|---|---|---|
| `child`, `alert_id` | text, primary key together | |
| `rule`, `level`, `kind`, `scale` | text | `kind` is the pack prefix |
| `raised_at`, `responded_at`, `acted_at`, `measured_at` | timestamptz | timestamps only: no text, no actor, no sensor, by design |
| `received_at` | timestamptz | |

`measured_at` is null in practice. A child fills it from posted `measured` rows, and `POST /actions` no longer takes one. The parent's funnel in `/rho` is computed from its own alerts only, and says so with `self_only: true`. `cleared_at` was dropped in schema 0.51: a node has no notion of an alert clearing.

### `alert_events`

The alert-event engine's stories ([Alerts](alerts.md#the-event-engine)): one row per issue per house, from the first candidate over its line to the all-clear. Written only under `ALERT_ENGINE=shadow` or `events`; empty under `rules`. It is named `alert_events` because `events` is the parent's ledger above.

| column | | |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | bigserial | |
| `issue`, `kind`, `level` | text | the issue (`heat`, `air`), the highest kind seen (`ahead` · `unusual` · `spike` · `sustained` · `danger`), the highest level |
| `opened_at`, `last_seen_at`, `last_sent_at`, `cleared_at` | timestamptz | `cleared_at` is null while the event is open; an open event clears after 30 minutes with no candidate |
| `peak` | double | the highest value seen |
| `rooms`, `places` | text[] | the sensors' names, and where each was (`inside`, `outside`) |
| `ever_sent` | bool | whether any message for it went out; an all-clear is sent only if so |
| `action_id` | text | the action the last message carried |
| `told_kind`, `told_peak`, `told_level`, `told_held`, `last_emitted_at` | | what the last message said, sent or held: the engine's escalation bookkeeping, kept so a restart does not forget it |

### `event_messages`

Every message the engine decided, sent or held.

| column | | |
|---|---|---|
| `id`, `ts` | | |
| `event_id` | bigint → `alert_events.id` | |
| `reason` | text | checked: `open` · `escalate` · `clear` |
| `kind` | text | the event's kind when this was decided; `danger` is never counted against the daily ceiling |
| `sent` | bool | in `shadow`, what would have been sent |
| `held` | text | why not: `quiet` · `ceiling` · `level`; null when sent |
| `mode` | text | `shadow` or `events` |
| `text` | text | the message as rendered, or null when it could not be |
| `action_id` | text | the action it carried; null for an all-clear or when none was chosen |

### `channel_roles`

What each `(source, metric)` **is**, written at every start from `config/channels.yml` and every pack's `channels.yml`: `role` (`ambient` · `enclosure` · `device_health` · `derived` · `index`), `comparable`, `unit`, `reference`, `declared_by`.

### `settings`

`key`, `value`, `updated_at`: the runtime overlay over `.env`, written from Set up, `planetai config set`, `PUT /settings` and the `settings_set` tool. Not readable by the rules' role. Its rows are left out of every dump, so a saved token never travels.

### `schema_version`

`version`, `applied_at`; one row per schema step: 0.4, 0.14, 0.20, 0.21, 0.22, 0.23, 0.50, 0.51, 0.52, 0.53. There is no step after 0.53 in v0.77, so `/health` reports `0.53` on an up-to-date node. Adding `decided` and then `dismissed` to the `actions` check did not add a step: the constraint is dropped and re-created inside the 0.20 block on every run.

### `release_notices`

`version`, `told_at`: one row per release the node has told its household about, so a restart or the hourly re-check never sends "a new version is out" twice for the same one. Added in schema 0.52, for `UPDATE_CHECK`. Written by `check_release()` in `app/main.py`; nothing else reads it.

### Pack tables

The `place` pack creates `place_features` (OpenStreetMap features with a PostGIS geometry), `place_runs`, `place_yearly` and `place_buildings_sat` (Open Buildings). Tables a pack creates inherit the read-only role's `SELECT` through default privileges.

## Views

| view | rows | columns |
|---|---|---|
| `readings_1h` | hourly means over all readings | `bucket, sensor_id, metric, mean, min, max, n` |
| `stats` | one per (sensor, metric), last 24 h, `kind='sensor'` only | `sensor_id, metric, indoor, local, kind, scale, lat, lon, name, last, last_ts, silent_minutes, mean_15m, mean_1h, mean_24h` |
| `observations` | the latest row per (sensor, metric) for `kind <> 'sensor'` | `sensor_id, metric, value, ts, name, kind, scale, local, cadence, meta` |
| `recent_15m` | quarter-hour means of the last 24 h, `kind='sensor'` only, with `apparent` (the no-wind indoor feels-like) derived wherever `temp` and `humidity` share a bucket | `bucket, sensor_id, metric, mean` |
| `usual_by_hour` (materialized) | each room's own normal for each local hour, from the fourteen complete local days before today, for `temp`, `humidity`, `pm25` and `apparent` | `sensor_id, metric, hour, median, p75, p90, n` |

`recent_15m` and `usual_by_hour` are what a rule with a `kind:` reads, so it can ask "for how long" and "against what usual" without rebuilding either from raw readings every minute. `usual_by_hour` is created empty and the app refreshes it at start and hourly, in `NODE_TZ`, so a rule that reads it before the first refresh fails, is logged, and runs again a minute later.

Sensors land in `stats`. Slow sources (portals, models, maps) land in `observations`, which keeps the latest row per source per metric forever; that is why a retired metric must not be read as this year's answer. A facility lands in neither, because it has no readings.

## The read-only role

`planetai_ro` is `NOLOGIN`, has `SELECT` on every table but `settings`, and writes nothing. Every rule and every cell runs as it, one statement at a time with `SET LOCAL ROLE`, so a rule cannot read a token into an alert text or change a row.

## Time and place inside the database

The session time zone is `NODE_TZ`, so `date_trunc('day', ts)` and `extract(hour from ts)` mean the household's day and hour; readings themselves are UTC instants. The node's position is available to SQL as `current_setting('planetai.lat')` and `current_setting('planetai.lon')`. Both are set on every connection the app opens. A `psql` session does not go through the app, so there an hour-of-day query answers in the database's own time zone and `planetai.lat` is not set.

## The database image

The `db` service runs `imresamu/postgis:16-3.4-alpine`, Postgres 16 with PostGIS 3.4, since v0.63. It publishes `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64` for the same tag; the `postgis/postgis` tag it replaced published amd64 only. It stays on Alpine because an existing node's data directory was created by musl. Opening one with a glibc build was measured on 19 September 2026: the node started, and its text indexes failed an integrity check with no warning from Postgres. Postgres is published on `127.0.0.1:5432` only. [ARM64.md](../ARM64.md) has the arm64 detail.

## Backups and restore

`backup.sh` runs nightly at 03:17 from cron, or on demand with `planetai backup`.

1. It refuses a `BACKUP_DIR` under `/Volumes`, `/mnt` or `/media` that is not mounted, rather than creating a local folder with the NAS's name.
2. It runs `pg_dump` with the `settings` table's rows left out (the table stays in the dump, empty), gzips it to `<node>-<date>.sql.gz`, and keeps it only if it is a valid gzip holding a `readings` table.
3. It deletes dumps older than `BACKUP_KEEP` days (default 30).
4. It writes yesterday's `/export` to `exports/<node>/YYYY-MM-DD.json` when `EXPORT_ENABLED=1` (the default), and adds it to IPFS when `IPFS_PUBLISH=1`.
5. It copies the dumps and exports to `BACKUP_REMOTE` with rclone, if that is set.
6. It writes the time to `LAST_OK` in `BACKUP_DIR`.

`planetai restore <dump>` asks you to type the node's name, takes a safety backup with `backup.sh`, stops the app, drops and recreates the database, restores the dump, re-applies `init.sql` and starts the app. It prints the number of readings when it is done. The dump carries no settings rows, so a restored node runs on `.env` until Set up is saved again; a Telegram bot connected from the dashboard needs `planetai telegram` once more.

The database stays on a local disk. SMB and NFS do not honour `fsync` and file locking, and a mount path that is not mounted becomes an empty local folder with the NAS's name. Backups are how the data reaches a NAS, and [Storage](storage.md) says where the copies go.

## Where this leads

The rows here reach screens and other nodes through the [API](api.md). A child's hourly push sends `readings_1h` to its parent's `POST /aggregates`, and the timestamps of `alerts` and `actions` to `POST /events`. [Federation](federation.md) is the page for pointing a child at a parent.
