# SPEC — custody, and what `local` is actually for

**Status: proposed. Nothing here is implemented. Approve or refuse it before any code moves.**

Two findings arrived on 10 September 2026 from two sessions that did not know about each other. Both are
correct. They point at the same column from opposite sides.

- **FCI ingestion map, gap 1.** `receive_aggregates()` stores a child's hourly means as `local=FALSE`,
  `kind='child'`. `app/index.py::_buckets()` counts only `WHERE s.local`. A community node aggregating ten
  homes therefore has **zero** local buckets, so every pack cell that wants `live` is demoted to `partial`.
  The roll-up path is built and cannot say `live`.
- **Peer-visibility §3.** `local=FALSE` is exactly the guard that keeps a stranger's node — `kind='peer'`,
  display-only — out of every Index cell, structurally rather than by convention. `/nearby` already stores
  other people's stations that way.

> **Provenance note.** Neither docs/proposals/peer-visibility.md nor the FCI ingestion map is in this
> repository, on any branch of it, or anywhere else under the FAB CITY project directory as of
> 12 September 2026. Their claims are restated above from the brief that commissioned this spec, not read
> from the files. Everything below §1 is read from the tree at `f5fd456`. If those two documents surface and
> contradict §1, the tree wins and this spec has a bug.

## §1 · The two meanings, with the lines

### What the core reads

`app/index.py:52`, the honesty check that decides whether any pack cell may say `live`:

```sql
SELECT count(*) AS n FROM readings_1h r JOIN sensors s USING (sensor_id)
WHERE s.local AND r.bucket > now() - interval '24 hours'
```

`packs/heat/cells.yml:13`, one pack cell, reading the same column directly:

```sql
JOIN sensors s ON s.sensor_id = t.sensor_id
WHERE s.local AND s.indoor AND t.metric = 'temp' AND t.bucket > now() - interval '30 days'
```

### What the column says it means

`init.sql:14–15`:

```sql
local     BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT FALSE,   -- TRUE = physically at this node (ours). FALSE = reference/context.
kind      TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'sensor',   -- sensor | portal | model | survey | child   (how the number was produced)
```

`local` was written on 2 September 2026 in `74a8b64` ("planetai-node v0.1 — node #1 live"), when a node was a
house and nothing else existed. `kind` did not exist yet; it arrived the next day in `15785db` (v0.4.3,
"multi-scale ingestion"), the same commit that wrote `_buckets`'s `WHERE s.local` and the `child` push. So the
honesty check was written for a home node on the same afternoon the roll-up path was invented, and nobody
reconciled them. That is the whole bug, and it is a day old in the history.

### The correction the brief needs

The brief says `local` is carrying geography and custody at once. **Read the code: it is not carrying
geography alone, and it never was.** `app/sources.py:70`:

```python
def stamp_local(sensors, lat, lon, radius_m):
    """`local` is ours AND here. The adapter decides ours; distance decides here.

    Only ever narrows: a sensor an adapter did not claim never becomes local, whatever its coordinates."""
    for s in sensors:
        if not s.get("local"):
            continue                     # ← a peer is never promoted by being close
```

`local` is already **claim ∧ proximity**. The adapter asserts "this is ours"; `LOCAL_RADIUS_M`
(`app/settings.py:53`, default 500 m) can only take that claim away. A peer across the street is `local=FALSE`
because no adapter claimed it — not because of its distance. That matters, because it means the fix is one
disjunct, not a new column, and the existing rows need no migration.

The one thing `local` genuinely cannot express is a **child**: in this node's chain, may roll up, and 400 m
down the lane.

### Every kind of row the `sensors` table holds today

One representative row per shape, as it is actually written. `kind` is the literal value in the column, not a
category name — there is no `'own'` kind and there is no `'peer'`, `'external'` or `'nearby'` kind.

| the row | written by | `kind` | `local` | in custody? | may reach a cell? |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `sc-19874` "BAYU NEW ENCLOSURE" — the house's own kit | `sources.smartcitizen` → `main.py:115` | `sensor` | **TRUE** | yes | **yes, may be `live`** |
| `pod-<id>` — a Meshtastic/MQTT pod, no coordinates | `main.py:182` (`_store`) | `sensor` | **TRUE** | yes | yes, `live` |
| a phone or contributor `POST /readings` | `main.py:182` | `sensor` | **TRUE** | yes | yes, `live` |
| `mahon1/sc-19874` — a child's hourly mean | `main.py:1625` (`receive_aggregates`) | `child` | **FALSE** | **yes** | **yes — and this is what is broken** |
| `bad-46949` — a Bali Air Dispatch station, 300 m away | `sources.baliairdispatch` (`sources.py:243`) | `sensor` | FALSE | no | `partial` only, as `Environmental\|City` |
| a stranger's node, once peer-visibility §9.4 lands | not written yet | `peer` | FALSE | no | **never** |
| `openmeteo-point`, `marine-point`, `earth-point`, `ee-point` | `sources.py:379,426`, `bootstrap.py:62` | `model` | FALSE | no | `partial` only, never `live` |
| a CKAN dataset row | `sources.py:404` | `portal` | FALSE | no | `partial` only |
| a survey response | declared in `init.sql:15`, **never written** | `survey` | — | (yes, when it exists) | `partial` |

Read the two bold rows together and the whole argument is there: **`child` is the only in-custody row that is
not `local`, and that is the only reason `_buckets` is wrong.** Everything else the table holds is already
classified correctly by `local` alone.

---

## §2 · The change, smallest form

### Recommended: no new column, no migration, one disjunct

```
custody  ≡  s.local OR s.kind = 'child'
```

`local` keeps the meaning `stamp_local` already gives it — *this node's own instrument, here*. It stops being
the custody test and becomes one of its two terms. `_buckets` and the cell SQL read custody; nothing else
changes.

**Why not `kind IN ('own','child')`, which the brief recommends.** It cannot be written: there is no `'own'`
kind. The nearest real spelling is `kind IN ('sensor','child')`, and that is **wrong on every `/nearby` row**.
`sources.baliairdispatch` writes other people's stations with `local=False` and no `kind`, so `main.py:123`'s
default fills in `kind='sensor'` — identical to the house's own kit. Node #1 holds up to 87 of these. Under
`kind IN ('sensor','child')` the entire Bali Air Dispatch ring becomes in-custody, `Environmental|Community`
starts averaging the island into the house's number, and the honesty check counts a stranger's data as proof
this node is measuring. That is a worse bug than the one being fixed.

The deeper reason is worth writing down, because it is the same mistake twice: **`kind` answers *how the
number was produced*** — its own comment at `init.sql:15` says so. A Bali Air Dispatch station is produced
exactly the way our kit is. It *is* a sensor. Loading custody onto `kind` would overload a second column the
way `local` got overloaded, and the next session would write a third spec.

**Explicitly checked, as asked:**

- **`nearby`'s rows** — `kind='sensor'`, `local=FALSE`. Correctly **out** of custody under the recommended
  rule, with no migration. They stay in the `stats` view (`init.sql:74` filters `s.kind='sensor'`), which is
  what `packs/nearby/rules.yml:41` and air-quality's `Environmental|City` cell need. Changing their `kind`
  would drop them out of `stats` into `observations` and silently kill the ring.
- **Open-Meteo's `kind='model'` rows** — `local=FALSE`. Correctly out. A model must never make a cell `live`
  (`AGENTS.md`: "A model or a portal is `partial`, whatever its quality"). Note `bootstrap.py:62` writes
  `openmeteo-point` with `"local": False` explicitly, so even the first-run prefill is safe.
- **`portal` rows** — `local=FALSE`. Out. Same reasoning.
- **`child` rows** — `local=FALSE`, `kind='child'`. In, via the new disjunct. This is the fix.

### The one case that forces something more

A `kind='peer'` row written with `local=TRUE` — a stranger's node genuinely across the street, geographically
inside `LOCAL_RADIUS_M` — satisfies `s.local` and would reach a cell. Today no code path can create it:
`stamp_local` only narrows and no adapter claims a peer. Once peer-visibility lands, a hand-edited row, a
restore from another node's dump, or a future adapter that forgets could.

Do not answer that by pasting `AND s.kind <> 'peer'` into fifteen SQL statements. `local` is read in 2 pack
cells, `_buckets`, and about a dozen rules; a predicate repeated fifteen times drifts within a month. Two
ways to say it once, both one line:

```sql
-- (a) recommended: the predicate lives in the schema, every SQL reads one word
ALTER TABLE sensors ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS custody BOOLEAN
  GENERATED ALWAYS AS (kind = 'child' OR (local AND kind <> 'peer')) STORED;

-- (b) or refuse the row at the boundary and keep `local OR kind='child'` in the SQL
ALTER TABLE sensors ADD CONSTRAINT sensors_peer_not_local CHECK (NOT (local AND kind = 'peer'));
```

**Recommend (a).** It is a generated column, not a column anyone writes: no writer changes, no migration of
values, no way for it to disagree with `local` and `kind`. Postgres 16 (`docker-compose.yml:4`,
`postgis/postgis:16-3.4-alpine`) has had generated columns since 12. `init.sql` is idempotent and re-applied
by `update.sh`, so this is additive in the way every other `ALTER ... IF NOT EXISTS` in that file is.

(b) is smaller but fails closed on an existing node: the `ALTER` is refused if a bad row already exists, which
turns a schema apply into a support ticket. (a) recomputes for every row and cannot fail.

**Kind values after this change:** `sensor | portal | model | survey | child | peer`. One added — `peer`, from
peer-visibility §9.4 — and `init.sql:15`'s comment updated to list it.

---

## §3 · What `live` means at each tier

`live` is `_buckets` ≥ a pack's `min_buckets` (`app/index.py:78–81`). Replacing `local` with custody changes
that sentence at exactly one tier.

**Home / Community node with its own kit — nothing changes.** Its sensors are `local`, `local` implies custody,
the count is the same count. Node #1's number does not move.

**Community or City node aggregating children.** `live` becomes: *at least one in-custody sensor reported in
the last 24 h*, where in-custody now includes the children's hourly means. A banjar node with no instrument of
its own, aggregating ten homes, would be able to say `live`.

**Should it?** Two readings, and they disagree:

- *For:* the number **was** measured, by instruments in this node's chain, by households who agreed to push
  them. `live` means measured, not measured-by-this-box. `ARCHITECTURE.md §7` refuses upgrading a state by
  aggregation — it does not refuse an aggregate being `live` when every input was. Ten homes' PM2.5 is a
  better Community number than one kit's, and requiring the banjar to buy a kit to describe air it already
  has ten honest measurements of is a tax on the tier that needs the least hardware.
- *Against:* `live` is a claim someone stands behind, and a node with no instrument has nothing to inspect
  when the number is wrong. It cannot service a sensor, check an enclosure, or answer "is that real?"

**Recommendation: a community node does NOT need to own a sensor, with one condition.** `live` at Community
and City requires **≥ 2 distinct in-custody sensors** reporting in 24 h, from **≥ 2 distinct children** where
the node has children. One child reporting is one household's kitchen, and a cell that says `live` off one
kitchen is the same lie as a model claiming `live`. Two is the smallest number that is a place rather than a
room. A home node with one kit is unaffected — it is describing one address and says so in its `unit` string.

Concretely: keep `min_buckets` as the hours test and add `min_sensors` (default 1, set to 2 by the core when
`NODE_SCALE` is not `community`, or whenever any `child` row exists). One extra `count(DISTINCT sensor_id)` in
`_buckets`. **This is the one question in this spec that is Tomas's call, not the code's.**

---

## §4 · The child push

### The metric name

Today `receive_aggregates` (`app/main.py:1625–1631`) writes:

```python
sid = f"{child}/{r['sensor_id']}"
INSERT INTO sensors (...) VALUES (%s,'child',%s,FALSE,'child',%s,'PT1H')
INSERT INTO readings (ts, sensor_id, metric, value) VALUES (%s,%s,%s,%s)   # metric = f"{r['metric']}_1h"
```

So a child's PM2.5 lands as metric `pm25_1h`. **No pack SQL anywhere matches `pm25_1h`** — every cell and rule
asks for `metric = 'pm25'`, `'temp'`, `'humidity'`. The cadence was encoded in the metric string, and the
metric string is the join key. That is the second half of gap 1: even after custody is fixed, a parent's
`Environmental|Community` cell would find nothing to average.

**Recommended: keep the metric name. Drop the `_1h` suffix.**

```python
# app/main.py:1631
VALUES (%s, %s, %s, %s)      # r["metric"], not f"{r['metric']}_1h"
```

The cadence already has a column and `receive_aggregates` already writes it: `sensors.cadence = 'PT1H'`, on
the child's own sensor row, one line above. A consumer that needs to know these are hourly means joins
`sensors` and reads `cadence` — the same place it reads `kind` and `local`. Nothing needs the suffix, and
nothing ever read it.

The bucket timestamp keeps the rest honest: `readings.ts` is the child's `r["bucket"]`, so an hourly mean
enters as one reading on the hour, and `readings_1h` (`init.sql:57`, `avg(value)` grouped by
`date_trunc('hour', ts)`) averages one row — the mean of one number is that number. The child's hour survives
unchanged. `readings`' `UNIQUE (sensor_id, metric, ts)` makes a re-push idempotent, as it already is.

**Pack SQL that changes: none.** That is the point of keeping the name. Every cell and rule that reads
`metric='pm25'` starts seeing children the moment custody is fixed, with no edit.

**Pack SQL that would have changed under the alternative** (teach each pack about `_1h`): both
`packs/air-quality/cells.yml` cells, `packs/heat/cells.yml`, `packs/insight/rules.yml` ×4,
`packs/air-quality/rules.yml` ×6, `packs/trust/rules.yml` ×3 — and every pack anyone writes afterwards.
Rejected on that count alone.

One consequence to state plainly: after this, `readings` at a parent holds hourly means and raw readings under
the same metric name, told apart only by their sensor row's `kind` and `cadence`. That is correct — a mean of
hourly means weights each child's hour equally, which is what a district number should do — but a pack that
wants raw-only must say `s.kind = 'sensor'`, exactly as `init.sql:74`'s `stats` view already does. The `stats`
view therefore continues to exclude children, and the rules that read `stats` are unaffected. Only the cells,
which read `readings_1h` directly, see them.

### ρ does not roll up, and must

`push_aggregates()` (`app/main.py:448–460`) sends one thing:

```python
cur.execute("SELECT bucket, sensor_id, metric, mean, min, max, n FROM readings_1h WHERE bucket > now() - interval '2 hours'")
httpx.post(f"{PARENT()}/aggregates", json={"node": NODE, "rows": rows, "scale": ...})
```

Readings only. So a parent's `Governance|<scale>` cell — `rho()` at `app/index.py:96`, computed from its own
`alerts` and `actions` tables — counts only alerts the parent raised itself. A City node that raised no alerts
has no ρ, while ten children below it are measuring ρ every day. ρ is, in `ARCHITECTURE.md §5`'s words, "the
brick nobody else has", and it currently stops at the address.

**Specify: a second push, events.** `POST /events`, same `AGGREGATE_TOKEN`, same hourly loop.

One row per alert, with exactly these fields:

| field | from | why |
|---|---|---|
| `alert_id` | `alerts.id`, namespaced `<child>/<id>` on arrival | so `actions` can point at it |
| `rule` | `alerts.rule_id` | which rule, so a parent can weigh `act` rules only |
| `level` | `alerts.level` | ρ counts `level='act'` alerts only (`index.py:106`) |
| `kind` | the alert's domain tag | so a parent can say ρ for air separately from ρ for heat |
| `raised_at` | `alerts.ts` | detect |
| `responded_at` | `min(actions.ts) WHERE stage='acknowledged'` | decide |
| `acted_at` | `min(actions.ts) WHERE stage='acted'` | deploy |
| `measured_at` | `min(actions.ts) WHERE stage='measured'` | measure |
| `cleared_at` | when the condition stopped holding | so an alert that resolved itself is not counted as acted on |

**And nothing else. No `text`, no `note`, no `actor`, no `sensor_id`.**

`alerts.text` is the household's own sentence — "shut the bedroom windows" describes a bedroom, which room it
is, and that somebody was home to be told. Per peer-visibility §7 it does not leave the address, and
`AGENTS.md`'s "raw readings stay on this machine" is the same refusal one level up. `actions.actor` is a
person's name. `sensor_id` would let a parent locate the room. The timestamps carry every fact ρ needs and
none of the facts a household would mind travelling; that is why the list is timestamps.

**The parent computes ρ. The child never sends a ratio.** A child sending `rho: 0.7` would be a number the
parent cannot check, cannot recompute when the definition of ρ changes, and cannot combine correctly (a mean
of ten ratios is not the ratio of the pooled counts). The parent runs `index.py::rho()` over the pooled events
with whatever definition is current on the parent — which is also how a change to the 24 h window or the `act`
filter reaches every historical child at once, with no re-push.

Storage at the parent: one `events` table mirroring these columns, keyed `(child, alert_id)`, upserted.
`rho()`'s query changes from `FROM alerts … LEFT JOIN actions` to a union of the parent's own two tables and
`events`. That is the one function to edit.

---

## §5 · Many communities per city

Ubud, Denpasar and Canggu each run a community node. All three emit `Environmental|Community` under
`city: bali`. The spine holds **one row per `(city, cell)`** — `cells-ingest/README.md` step 5, "One row per
(city, cell), forever" — so the three overwrite each other, last write wins, and the Index shows whichever
node published most recently with no indication that two others exist.

**Recommended shape, from the ingestion map: the city node publishes the aggregated `*|Community` beside its
own `*|City`.**

The three community nodes push to the Denpasar city node, which is already the only `FCI_PUBLISHER=1` node in
Bali (`ingest.py:17`, `AGENTS.md:12`). It computes `Environmental|Community` over its in-custody sensors —
which, after §2 and §4, are the three communities' hourly means — and publishes that one row alongside
`Environmental|City` computed from Bali Satu Data and the reference stations.

What this preserves, and the reason to prefer it:

- **The Index keeps 20 cells.** `ingest.py:61` builds `VALID_CELLS` as the 4 × 5 product and drops anything
  else; `cells-worker` serves that shape. `README.md` records four rows already in the spine with invented
  scales (`Environmental|Beach`, `|Harbor`, `|Industrial`, `|Residential`) that are invisible to every
  surface. Nothing here adds a twenty-first.
- **`ALLOWED_CITIES` stays four strings** — `["barcelona", "boston", "santiago", "bali"]` (`ingest.py:56`),
  hardcoded on both sides. No `bali-ubud`.
- **One node per pilot writes** (`AGENTS.md:12`, the tier contract in `skills/publish-to-index/SKILL.md`).
  Three community nodes publishing into one city is that rule broken, whatever the mechanism.
- **Ubud does not vanish.** It keeps its own cells on its own dashboard and its own `GET /cells`, which is the
  architecture's position on every home node already. Denpasar's `notes` field carries "aggregated over 3
  community nodes, 14 sensors" — the sentence that tells a reader the number is a district, not a bedroom.

**The alternative, and why it is rejected.** Give each community node its own city key — `bali-ubud`,
`bali-denpasar`, `bali-canggu` — so each gets its own row. Rejected because it breaks three things at once:
`ALLOWED_CITIES` and `cells-worker`'s hardcoded list both grow without bound (a 404 on the read side for any
key added to only one of them); "one node per pilot writes" becomes unenforceable, since a pilot is no longer
a city; and the FCI methodology's Community **scale** would be re-encoded as a city **name**, so
`index.fab.city` would show four Balis and no Bali. The Community scale already exists as an axis; a second
encoding of it in the city column is the `Environmental|Beach` mistake with a different spelling.

---

## §6 · The publisher moves into this repo

Today `cells-ingest` lives in the private `fci-index` repo. `skills/publish-to-index/SKILL.md` therefore has
to end with "write to info@fab.city" and cannot show the command, and `BALI.md` — a real runbook — is
readable by nobody outside it.

**Specify: a `publish` subcommand of the node CLI, in this repo, refusing exactly what `ingest.py`
refuses today.** (Written here as a subcommand name rather than as a command line, because it is not one yet
and `tools/check_docs.py` is right to refuse a doc that pretends otherwise.)

- `FCI_PUBLISHER != 1` → refuse (`ingest.py:141`), with the same message: a home node feeds its parent.
- No `FCI_AIRTABLE_TOKEN` → refuse (`ingest.py:148`).
- `FCI_CITY` not in `ALLOWED_CITIES` → refuse (`ingest.py:138`).
- `--dry-run` works without either, prints the diff, writes nothing.
- The five steps unchanged, each of which can only lose rows: fetch, normalise against the 20 keys, collapse
  to newest per key, diff against the city's existing rows, PATCH-or-POST.

**Public: the code.** `ingest.py` is 200 lines of `urllib` over a documented eight-field row shape. Nothing in
it is a secret; the base id `appmNQaDGEFE9VcYh` is already in the file and is useless without a token. Making
it public means the `publish-to-index` skill can show a real command, a pilot can dry-run before asking for anything,
and the refusals become reviewable by the people they refuse.

**Private: the token issuance.** Per-pilot Airtable PATs, scoped to one base, issued by hand by Tomas to a
named operator. No self-serve, no automation, no path from this repository to a token. That is the whole
access-control model and it does not move. `SKILL.md`'s last mile stays "write to info@fab.city" — what
changes is that everything before the last mile is now runnable.

Also public, and worth more than the script: BALI.md becomes docs/PUBLISHING.md, the runbook the second
pilot copies.

**Trigger (the file itself already names it — `SKILL.md`: "When three pilots are publishing, the ingest script
may move into `tools/`… Not yet"):** after Bali has published once from the Denpasar portal, and before
Vivanco's node reaches City tier. One pilot proves the path; the second must not need a private repo to walk
it. Not before Bali publishes — a tool that has never written a row is not a tool, it is a proposal.

---

## §7 · Invariants this adds to `AGENTS.md`

To be appended to "Invariants. Do not break these." as sentences:

- **Peers never roll up.** A `kind='peer'` row is display-only: it reaches no Index cell, no `_buckets` count,
  and no aggregate pushed to a parent, whatever its coordinates say.
- **Peers never drive an alert or a report line.** A node may show a neighbour's number and must never act on
  it. The ring in `packs/nearby` compares against peers; it does not alert about them.
- **State is never upgraded by aggregation.** A parent's cell is `partial` if any input was. `live` requires
  in-custody measurement in the last 24 h, at the parent's own tier. (This one exists at
  `ARCHITECTURE.md §7`; it belongs in `AGENTS.md` too, because it is the rule an agent is most likely to
  "fix".)
- **Place geometry leaves at no rung.** Coordinates, room names, and a household's own sentences stay on the
  machine that recorded them. Aggregates carry values and timestamps; alerts carry timestamps. Neither
  carries where.
- **Exactly one node per pilot writes to the spine.** A pilot is a city in `ALLOWED_CITIES`. Every other node
  computes its cells, shows them, and passes them no further.

---

## §8 · The migration, as a sketch

**Not run. Not written as a file. This is what it would have to do.**

If §2's recommendation is taken, there is almost nothing to migrate — that is the argument for it.

**Order.**

1. `init.sql` gains `peer` in the `kind` comment and, if (a) is chosen, the generated `custody` column. Both
   additive and idempotent, applied to a live database by `update.sh` the way every `ALTER … IF NOT EXISTS`
   in that file already is.
2. **No `UPDATE` of existing rows.** Every row is already correct: own kits and pods are `local=TRUE`,
   children are `kind='child'`, `/nearby` and models and portals are `local=FALSE`. The generated column
   computes itself on apply. The only rows whose classification changes are `child` rows, and they change
   from *wrongly excluded* to *included*, which is the fix.
3. `_buckets` and the two `s.local` cell SQLs read custody. `packs/nearby/rules.yml` and the `stats`-reading
   rules are untouched — they ask about the ring and want `local` in its own meaning.
4. `receive_aggregates` drops the `_1h` suffix (§4). Children that pushed before the change leave
   `<metric>_1h` rows behind; they are inert (no SQL matches them) and expire out of every window on their
   own. Delete them or don't.
5. `POST /events` and the parent-side `events` table (§4) — new, nothing to migrate.

**The query that proves nothing reached a cell that should not have.** Run on a node after the apply; it must
return zero rows.

```sql
-- Every sensor now in custody that was not in custody before, and why.
-- Expect: only kind='child' rows. Anything else is a row this change silently promoted.
SELECT s.sensor_id, s.source, s.kind, s.local, s.scale,
       count(r.*) AS readings_24h, max(r.ts) AS last_seen
FROM sensors s LEFT JOIN readings r
  ON r.sensor_id = s.sensor_id AND r.ts > now() - interval '24 hours'
WHERE (s.kind = 'child' OR (s.local AND s.kind <> 'peer'))   -- the new custody rule
  AND NOT s.local                                             -- the old one
  AND s.kind <> 'child'                                       -- the intended change
GROUP BY 1,2,3,4,5;
```

And its mirror, which must also return zero — nothing that was in custody fell out:

```sql
SELECT sensor_id, source, kind, local FROM sensors
WHERE s.local AND NOT (kind = 'child' OR (local AND kind <> 'peer'));
```

**What a node on v0.30 needs** — node #1 today. `update.sh` applies `init.sql` to the live database on every
update, so the schema arrives on its own; v0.30's database already has `kind`, `scale` and `cadence` (added
in v0.4.3, before it). Nothing to do by hand. The one thing that changes under node #1 is *nothing*: it has no
children and no peers, all five of its kits are `local=TRUE`, and `_buckets` returns the same 192 it returns
today. Verified in `tests/test_custody.py`, which replays node #1's own 7 September dump.

## §9 · The gate

`tests/test_custody.py` exists in this branch and **fails on `main` today**. It is written against the current
tree, not against the proposal, so it is the thing that says whether the proposal landed.

It builds two DuckDB nodes from `init.sql` and node #1's real sensors and readings
(`tests/data/node1-*.tsv`, the same fixtures `tests/trustdb.py` uses): one without a peer, one with a single
extra row —

```
peer-1 · source 'baliairdispatch' · kind='peer' · local=TRUE · indoor=TRUE · 40 m from the node
        · pm25, temp and humidity readings through the last three hours
```

— a peer across the street, geographically local, reporting right now. Then it asserts:

1. `_buckets`'s SQL, verbatim from `app/index.py:55`, returns the **same count** on both. **Fails today:**
   192 → 204.
2. Every `packs/*/cells.yml` SQL returns the **same value** on both, within floating-point tolerance.
   **Fails today:** `packs/heat/cells.yml`'s `Social|Community` goes 0.0 → 4.0.
3. Node #1's own five kits still count — the fix must not be "exclude everything".

Assertion 2 compares the two databases rather than naming packs, so a pack added next year that reads a peer
breaks it without anyone remembering this spec. Floating-point tolerance is not decoration:
`packs/air-quality/cells.yml`'s first cell changes in the 15th decimal purely from summation order, and an
exact comparison would report a leak that is not there.

**The file is not in `tests/all` yet, and must not be added until the implementation lands.** The runner
(`tests/all:126`) asserts it runs exactly 31 suites and fails the whole run on any skip not in
`EXPECTED_SKIPS`. So CI is green today because the suite is not in the list, not because the suite is lying.
The `CI=1` self-skip in the file is belt and braces for anyone who wires it early.

**What the implementation session does, in order:**

```
1. bash tests/test_custody.py          # watch it fail — 2 assertions, the numbers above
2. implement §2 and §4
3. bash tests/test_custody.py          # now passes
4. delete the CI=1 guard at the top of the file
5. add `test_custody|PYTHONPATH=app python3 tests/test_custody.py` to tests/all's SUITES
6. change tests/all's `-ne 31` to `-ne 32`, and the comment above it
```

Step 6 is the one people forget; the runner fails loudly if they do, which is why it is written that way.
