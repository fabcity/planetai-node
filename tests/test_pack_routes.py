"""A pack serves its own routes (packs/<id>/routes.py), mounted by app/packs.py::routers() when main is imported.

GET /forecast and GET /nearby were core routes until 23 Oct 2026. They answer as before while their pack is on, 404
while it is off (PACKS_ENABLED can change in Set up without a restart), and a pack puts its own paths on the `open`
share list from pack.yaml. Importing main still opens no database.
