"""The custody gate: a peer across the street reaches no cell, however local it looks.

Written before the implementation and run failing first — at 9971a80 it reported

    _buckets   192 -> 204        a kind='peer' row with local=TRUE counted as this node's own data
    heat cell    0.0 -> 4.0      packs/heat/cells.yml read s.local with no kind filter

which is the only way to know a gate is wired to the thing it claims to guard. docs/SPEC_custody.md is the
argument; this file is what holds it.

`local` was written on 2 September 2026 for a node that was a house (74a8b64). `kind` arrived the next day
with the child push (15785db), and nothing reconciled them. `local` still means "ours AND here"
(app/sources.py::stamp_local) — custody is `local OR kind='child'`, and a peer is neither. See §1 and §2.

Method: build the same node twice, once with one extra peer row, and assert every number comes out identical.
Comparing two databases rather than naming packs means a pack written next year that reads a peer breaks this
without anyone remembering the spec. Nothing here asserts HOW custody is expressed, so the implementation is
free to choose the generated column, the CHECK, or the two-clause predicate.
