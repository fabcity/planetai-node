"""POST /actions with a `choice` (a pack button's answer, app/buttons.py): the endpoint refuses a value the alert did not
offer (400), an unknown alert (404) and an alert older than 72 hours (409); takes the stage from the button and
ignores a sent one; keeps DECISION_REQUIRED for `acted` buttons only; writes one row per (alert, actor, choice), where
a repeat tap with no words changes nothing and a later note replaces the earlier one. `action` is lifted from
app/main.py by AST against a fake cursor, as tests/test_rule_buttons.py lifts run_rules (importing main starts a second
MQTT client); `buttons` is the real module. Run: PYTHONPATH=app python3 tests/test_action_choice.py
