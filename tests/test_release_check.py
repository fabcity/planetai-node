"""A node says when a newer PLANETAI is out, once, and never installs it (Tomas, 30 Sep 2026).

check_release() asks planetai.fab.city/node0/get/VERSION once a day, puts what it found in /health (the header
and `planetai doctor` read it there), and sends Telegram one message per version. UPDATE_CHECK=off asks nothing.
