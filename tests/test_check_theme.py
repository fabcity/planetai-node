"""The guard on the guard: tools/check_theme.py must fail on an edited frozen file WITH NO DESIGN
REPO, because that is CI — the one place every pull request is checked.

It did not, from the day it was written until 19 September 2026: absent sibling, one line, exit 0.
Nothing asserted otherwise, which is why nobody noticed. This asserts it. (The checker itself never
reaches a node — bundle.sh excludes tools/check_* — but the tarball carries the files it guards, so
an edit that passes CI is on every screen in the house after the next update.)

Runs against a copy of the real tree, so it tests the file in tools/ rather than a paraphrase.
