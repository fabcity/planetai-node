/* measure.mjs — the node dashboard, measured from computed layout rather than looked at.
 *
 * ORIGIN. This file is the September UX review's skeleton script, moved into the repo it measures
 * and extended. It was written for Part 2 of that review and lived at
 * `planetai-design/design/audit/2026-09/ux-review/skeleton/measure.mjs` on branch
 * `ux-review-2026-09`; every number in `docs/design/UX_REVIEW_2026-09_skeleton.md` came out of it.
 * Everything above the `TARGETS` section is that script, unchanged except where marked. There is
 * one of these and there must stay one of these: a second measuring script is two sets of numbers
 * that can disagree about the same page.
 *
 * WHAT IS NEW HERE, and why each one exists:
 *   · the page under test is an argument, not a constant. `PAI_STATIC` points at any `app/static`
 *     tree and `PAI_PAGE` at a standalone HTML file, so the shipped page, a redesign branch and a
 *     drawing that happens to be HTML are all measured by the same code on the same day.
 *   · `PAI_OUT` puts the renders somewhere other than beside this file.
 *   · COLLECT also reads the attributes the redesign's targets are written in terms of —
 *     data-num, data-cmp, data-ref, data-kind, aria-hidden, the accessible name of an SVG — and
 *     records DOM order, which T6 is about.
 *   · `targets` computes T1-T7 per render and prints one table. A target with no script behind it
 *     is an opinion.
 *
 * Per render it writes three things:
 *
 *   <name>.json         every visible element: tag, role, data-component, box, margin/padding/gap,
 *                       font-size/weight/line-height, z-index, position; plus every text line box.
 *   <name>_wire.png     a wireframe on a blank ground: text as grey bars at its real line boxes,
 *                       images/canvases/SVGs hatched, controls outlined, nothing else.
 *   <name>_guides.png   the same drawing with a 1 px guide at every left edge three or more
 *                       elements share.
 *
 * Nothing is written to either container. Every request for `/static/*` and for the document
 * itself is intercepted and fulfilled from `PAI_STATIC`, so what is measured is that tree's page
 * against the containers' live API. The refused state is produced by fulfilling `/issues` with the
 * exact 403 body `app/main.py` builds at SHARE_LEVEL=off — no setting on either node is touched.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node measure.mjs render <job>...      one or more job names (or "all")
 *   node measure.mjs steps                320 -> 1920 in 20 px steps on Now and Wall
 *   node measure.mjs stall <job>          layout with the API stalled, then released
 *   node measure.mjs sheets               contact sheet per view from the wireframes
 *   node measure.mjs header               the header's shape against the node's own name and place
 *   node measure.mjs targets              T1-T7 per render, against the targets table
 *   node measure.mjs audit <job>...       T9: bytes per refresh, axe, named SVGs, motion
 *   node measure.mjs shots <job>...       JPEG, one device pixel: the fold and the whole page
 *   node measure.mjs analyse <table>      grid spacing rhythm lines align type headings order
 *                                         dist wall dom anatomy components stack
 *   node measure.mjs list                 the job table
 *
 * Env: PAI_STATIC   the app/static tree to serve (default: this repo's)
 *      PAI_PAGE     a standalone HTML file to measure instead of a node page (Phase 1 directions)
 *      PAI_OUT      where renders are written (default: beside this file)
 *      PAI_DESIGN_REPO  where playwright is installed (default: ../planetai-design)
 *      PAI_ADMIN_TOKEN, PAI_ACT_TOKEN   the setup-unlocked and arrange jobs only.
 *      Never printed, never written to any output file.
 *
 * Playwright is a DEV dependency of the sibling design repo and not of this one: a node installs
 * this repository and must never be asked for a browser. So it is resolved by path, and a machine
 * without it is told rather than crashed at.

 * `dashboard.js`'s own `snapshot()` reads `/issues` (or `/issues/fixtures/<name>` in fixture mode),
 * `/health`, `/settings` and `/place/geojson` before it draws anything. Getting a real answer to
 * those four used to mean a bootstrapped container was running at POP — heavy to stand up for a
 * rendering task, and the wrong container besides: this branch's `/issues` is not built yet, and
 * would not be in a container even if it were. So, when PAI_LIVE is not '1', this repo answers its
 * own node's endpoints instead of asking one — a render becomes hermetic: no node, no container, no
 * network. `PAI_LIVE=1` is unchanged: it still measures a running container with no interception at
 * all, which is the whole point of that flag.
 *
 * These seven are answered offline: the original four, plus `/earth`, `/trust` and `/forecast`,
 * which dashboard.js's `snapshot()` calls unconditionally AFTER the `if (FIXTURE)` branch — they
 * are not part of "the page would stop being renderable from a fixture alone" (that comment is
 * about `/issues` alone) and a fixture-mode render still asks for all three. Before these three
 * were intercepted, that request fell through `route.continue()` to whatever was listening at the
 * render origin: on the machine this file was written on, a local node, which answered them empty;
 * on a machine with nothing listening there, a connection that never gets accepted, caught by
 * dashboard.js's own `.catch(() => null)` into the same empty state — slower, and not hermetic,
 * but the same empty state either way, which is why the Sentinel strip, the AlphaEarth record, the
 * trust card and the forecast card have only ever been seen empty. Everything else `dashboard.js`
 * fetches (`/alerts`, `/rho`, `/sensors`, `/nearby`, `/cells`, `/sparks`, `/report/latest`) really
 * is never asked for in fixture mode: `snapshot()` takes a different branch entirely when
 * `?fixture=` is set and calls only `/issues/fixtures/<name>` for the snapshot itself.

/* /earth, /trust and /forecast used to fall through `route.continue()` to whatever happened to be
 * listening at the render origin — a local node, on the machine this file was written on, which
 * answered them empty. On a machine (or a CI runner) with nothing listening there, the same
 * `route.continue()` hangs on a connection that will never be accepted and then rejects, and
 * dashboard.js's own `.catch(() => null)` around each of the three (see snapshot(), further down
 * this file) turns that into the same empty state anyway — so every render anyone has looked at
 * has shown these three empty, by accident, slowly, and only because nothing crashed loudly enough
 * to notice. That is not hermetic (it still reaches out to the network, even if nothing answers)
 * and it is not fast. These three routes answer instead, deterministically and offline, so a
 * render never depends on what else happens to be running.
 *
 * The empty bodies below are not copied off a running node — the invariants in AGENTS.md say never
 * to touch app/ for this task, so `q()`'s SQL cannot be re-run, and main.py imports psycopg,
 * bootstrap and paho-mqtt at module scope, none of which this checkout may need installed just to
 * measure a page. Each is instead the shape main.py's own route hands back when there is nothing
 * in the database to find, read off that route's source rather than executed:
 *   /trust     (main.py:896)  one row per local sensor — with none, an empty list.
 *   /forecast  (main.py:1024) point + two empty lists + fixed attribution + far_from_node: null.
 *   /earth     (main.py:1193) the earth pack IS enabled in this checkout (packs/earth/pack.yaml
 *              exists and nothing in presets/bali.env restricts PACKS_ENABLED — verified by running
 *              app/packs.py's own manifests() against this repo's packs/ directory), so `enabled`

 * ROLES is the one place a target names a part of the page. A direction is a drawing and the
 * shipped page is a renderer, and both have to be measured by the same code, so each role is a
 * list of selectors tried in order and the table says which one answered. A role nothing answers
 * is reported as absent rather than skipped: the shipped page carries no data-kind at all, and
 * that zero is the baseline T3 is measured against.

/* WHERE THE AIR IS — T2c, decomposed.
 *
 * T2's empty-share leg says the first screen at 1440 is 57 % air and does not say where. Prompt 7
 * guessed with a method of its own — unioning element boxes over a coarse grid — and got 20-40 %,
 * because a section's own container box marks everything inside it as used. That number was wrong
 * and the disagreement was the tell.
 *
 * So this uses aTargets' grid VERBATIM: the same 4 px cells, the same predicate (an element that
 * carries direct text, or is media, or is a control, marks its whole box), the same `read` variant
 * that drops what the page marked aria-hidden. Nothing here re-decides what full means. What it adds
 * is attribution: for every EMPTY cell, which part of the page it sits in.
 *
 * Three readings, because "where" has three useful answers:
 *
 *   · by part — the air inside each named component's own box, which is a layout question for that
 *     component, and the air inside no component at all, which is a spacing question between them.
 *   · down the page — the empty share of each 60 px stripe, which says whether the air is one hole
 *     or spread evenly.
 *   · across the page — the empty share of each tenth of the width, which is the question the lead's
 *     two-column grid raises: is one column carrying the whole screen.
 *
 * A cell is attributed to the SMALLEST named component containing it, so the lead's own box does not
 * swallow the air inside the meters. Scaffold is not a part: HTML, BODY, MAIN, .wrap and a view
 * SECTION are containers, not things on the screen, and attributing air to them says nothing.

 * draws a section it has never heard of, and the targets survive it.
 *
 * HOW A STRANGER GETS IN. A pack's dashboard contribution is one more static file the node serves,
 * which calls `window.PAI.register` when it parses. Here that timing is reproduced exactly, with a
 * setter on `window.PAI`: the moment dashboard.js assigns it, the stranger registers — before
 * `route()` draws anything, and without the page having been edited to expect it.
 *
 * Four sections, because a stranger is not always well behaved:
 *   water        draws a stack of its own, with a unit per cell
 *   water-deep   declares a need this node does not have
 *   water-bad    throws
 *   water-fifth  draws a FIFTH card kind, which T3 says does not exist
 *
 * The first three are the contract's promises. The fourth is the one that must show up as damage:

 *   · under reduced motion it draws ONE frame. Not zero — a reader who has asked for stillness is
 *     still owed the picture — and not a loop.
 *   · with motion on it is STILL MOVING when the floor ends, which is the one claim here that is
 *     about the drawing rather than the DOM, and the one that needed the canvas read.
 *
 * Driven through PAI_ASKING, which exists for this: a surface that only appears while a fetch is in
 * flight cannot be caught by a screenshot, and one that only animates when the browser says the tab
 * is visible cannot be timed from a headless run at all.

/* ------------------------------------------------------------------ the ask pane
 *
 * Three things the page owes the pane, asked of the page itself: with no model it still searches the
 * documentation and shows the two ways to give it a voice; with one, a request that reaches for a
 * setting draws a card saying what it is now, what it would be, what leaves and how to undo it, and
 * asks for the token rather than writing; and nothing the pane does sends a write to /settings.
 * Horizontal scroll with the pane open is `overflow`'s, which runs every view and mode with it on. */
