// HEIGHT_MARGIN (8%): a page that grew a whole section would clear it; a few px of font-metric
// drift between machines will not. EMPTY_MARGIN (+6 points): emptiness creeping up by a couple of
// points is layout noise (a line wrapping differently at a slightly different font); +6 points is
// roughly a whole section's worth of ground going unused, which is the H1 complaint this redesign
// exists to answer — a regression there is worth failing on, and a couple of rounding points is not.
// Re-recorded 21 Sep 2026, prompt 3's Observe stage, AND against a different fixture.
//
// THE FIXTURE CHANGED, which matters more than the numbers. This gate measured node1-2026-09-06,
// a capture with no `sensors`, no `issues`, no `forecast`, no `trust`, no `nearby` and no `reach` —
// so every section that reads one of those was never exercised here, and the wall was measured
// against a house with four stations when node #1 has six. It now measures node1-2026-09-21d: node
// #1 as it is today, on v0.69. The first thing that found was the wall at 1,107 px on a 1,080 px
// screen, which had been true on the real node for weeks under a green gate.
//
// Heights are up because Observe gained three sections on purpose — the matrix, the day and the
// sources — because the request ledger became a section of its own, because Decide gained the
// four-grain row, the two boundaries and the sentence template, because Act gained the ring strips
// and where-to-go, because Measure gained the Figures ledger — eighteen rows, the whole page cited
// once — and because the richer fixture draws more in the sections that were already there. The 8%
// margin refused every one of them, which is what it is for.
//
// 1440's emptiness is re-recorded DOWN, from 61.3 to 57.4: the redesign is meant to drive that
// number and locking in the gain is the point of recording it. 390's is NOT re-recorded. It is
// 42.6% against a 37.7% baseline — inside the +6 margin, but the wrong way, and writing 42.6 here
// would make that the new normal. It is a watch item, not a new standard.
