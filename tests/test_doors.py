"""The five doors (/?layout=doors): what they read, and that they read only what a screen is given.

buildD() and flowFrom() run in node on node #1's capture (app/issues/fixtures/node1-2026-10-06-figures.json); the
prototype in planetai-design drew from a hand-built copy of the same capture, and these were checked against it
value for value on 7 Oct 2026. Here the checks are the ones that must keep holding: the shapes the doors read, the
token-only parts left empty without the token, and every file the page names served by its NAME.
