"""The node's fundamental sources (app/fundamentals.py, GET /health/sources) and the doctor that prints them.

Tomas, 15 Oct 2026: "During the install or update of the node planetai doctor should run, but also the user should be
guided to have the fundamental data sources of the node running." So: every fix names a setting, a Set up section and
a command that exist; the states partition a fresh node, a working node and a broken one the way a household would;
the doctor's block is the real function lifted out of bin/planetai, fed the real assess(); and install, update and
setup each run the doctor.
