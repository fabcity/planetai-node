"""The forecast pack, against BMKG's and Open-Meteo's real answers for node #1's point on 7 September 2026.

Run: PYTHONPATH=/tmp/stub:app python3 tests/test_forecast.py
The fixtures are the payloads as they came back, saved whole. What is checked is what fails silently: a village
code for the wrong village, a unit that changed under us, and a forecast with no issue time — which cannot be
told from a fresh one afterwards.
