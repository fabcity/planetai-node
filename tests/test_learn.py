"""The learn layer quotes the documentation, so this proves it still is a quote.

Every panel in learn mode puts words in front of a household and says they are the node's own
documentation. The only thing standing between that claim and a paraphrase is tools/build_learn.py,
and the only thing standing between the claim and rot is its --check. So:

  · every quote in app/static/learn.json is a verbatim substring of the docs/site page it cites,
    right now, against the real tree (the invariant itself, asserted directly and not through the
    tool that maintains it), and it carries that page's own `# Title`, which is what the panel cites;
  · every section dashboard.js registers carries at least one mark, and every key a section names
    is one tools/build_learn.py has, so no part of the page is left unexplained and no question
    mark opens nothing;
  · editing a quote out of its page fails the build, naming the mark;
  · a quote that grows past sixty words fails the build rather than being drawn and cut off;
  · --check fails when the committed file is not what the docs say, and passes again after a
    rebuild. Both directions, because a gate that only ever passes is not a gate.
