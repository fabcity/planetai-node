"""Place maps without a database: what a drawing must be before it is stored, and the palette the server holds.

A drawing arrives as a GeoJSON Feature from the page, an agent or curl, and app/maps.py refuses one that is not what
its kind says, in a sentence the page shows as it is. The route-level half, against Postgres, is
tests/test_maps_pg.py. Run: PYTHONPATH=app python3 tests/test_maps.py
