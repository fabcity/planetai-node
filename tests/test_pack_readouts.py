"""A pack adds readouts to an issue (docs/decisions/2026-10-01-packs.md, point 4), and never replaces anything.

pack_readouts() on its own first, then issues.load() reading a real packs folder written here, with PACKS_ENABLED on
and off, then the engine turning a merged readout into a number only when its sensor has a row. Last, the guarantee
that matters for every node that exists today: no shipped pack declares readouts, so load() is exactly the files.
Run: PYTHONPATH=app python3 tests/test_pack_readouts.py
