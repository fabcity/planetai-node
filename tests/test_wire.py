"""Every wire format says which format it is, and no receiver ever refuses one it does not know.

ARCHITECTURE.md §3 names the contracts that must not change casually. One of them was versioned
(`fci-cells-v0`); the nightly export — pinned to IPFS forever — carried a licence and no schema
version, `GET /issues` is the one document a client draws and had none, and the two pushes travel
between nodes on different releases with none. This asserts the five keys and, more importantly, the
rule that makes them safe to add: **a receiver logs and processes, it never refuses.**

That rule is not decoration. A parent one release behind has to keep accepting a child one release
ahead, or the first operator to update their own node silently stops the district's numbers — and
nobody would find out, because a push that 400s is a line in a log on a machine in a cupboard.
