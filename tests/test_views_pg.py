"""stats, observations and the archive of silence on a real database: the same rows as the queries they replaced.

On 24 Oct 2026 the three were rewritten for speed (GET /issues spent most of its SQL in them on node #1): `stats`
aggregates on (sensor_id, metric) and joins the sensor after, `observations` and engine.SILENT_SQL walk
readings_lookup instead of sorting every row. This seeds the cases each one has to get right and holds every row to
the old definition, kept here as the reference. Needs a Postgres with init.sql applied, at RHO_PG_URL (CI's lint
job starts one); without it the suite skips.
Run: RHO_PG_URL=postgresql://planetai:x@127.0.0.1:5432/planetai PYTHONPATH=app PACKS_DIR=packs python3 tests/test_views_pg.py
