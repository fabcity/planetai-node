"""The report the node writes itself, and the bundle it writes it from.

The fixture below is a real bundle, taken from a node seeded with eight days shaped like node #1: a kitchen that
cooks at six, a porch, a public reference down the road, a radio that stopped talking four days ago, and the
three model points. It is the ruler for everything downstream — the model's rewrite is checked against these
numbers and nothing else — so it is written out here in full rather than generated, and it is read by eye.
