"""The Telegram buttons contract (SPEC_alerts §7): the keyboard the app writes under an event message and the
parser the bot answers it with are two ends of one promise — ev:<event_id>:<stage> — and the Doesn't-fit
follow-up keeps a note without ever eating a command or a stale chat line.

No imports of main or agent_loop (importing either starts side effects): the functions are lifted whole by AST,
the way tests/test_run_rules_modes.py lifts run_rules."""
