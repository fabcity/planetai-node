# session it opens is read-only, a query stops at 30 s so a month-wide panel cannot starve the node, and it holds
# four connections at most. The session timezone is the node's, as app/main.py::db() sets it, so a panel's hour
# of day is the household's hour. Run on every start; the password is made once and kept in the volume.
