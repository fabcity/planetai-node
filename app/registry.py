"""The network's source registry, as the node carries it. Domain-blind.

    load()    -> (entries, version)   the vendored snapshot of awesome-fabcity-data
    find()    -> entries, filtered

`data/sources/` is a pinned copy of the registry (tools/sync_registry.sh), mounted read-only. It is
what the network has decided can be measured at each pillar and scale — 209 rows at the time of
writing, against the fourteen sources a node actually reads.

That gap is the point. `index.cells()` can only emit rows this node can compute, so the cell nobody
has an adapter for is simply absent from `/cells`, and until now absent meant unanswerable. The
registry answers it: `GET /sources?cell=Social|City` says what is filed for that cell, and each
entry's `adapter` — `core:openmeteo_air`, `pack:coast` — says which of it anything here reads yet.

This module names no metric, no source and no pillar. It loads, filters and serves; every word of
vocabulary in it came out of the registry's own schema. Adding a source is still a PR upstream and a
re-pin (docs/SOURCES.md), never a change here.

Reads index.json, not the YAML beside it: the same one file `bin/planetai` reads, with the standard
library, because a node's Python has no PyYAML.

def cell_counts() -> dict[str, dict[str, int]]:
    """{cell: {"capable", "reviewed", "candidate"}} — three honest numbers per cell.

    This replaces counts_by_cell(), which answered a question nobody was asking. Two changes.

    **What a cell is counted FROM.** An entry is counted against every cell in its `feeds_cells` —
    the cells a node can actually fill from it — and only against its own path-derived `cell` when
    `feeds_cells` is ABSENT, so nothing vanishes from the numbers merely because nobody has
    backfilled it yet. Present-but-empty is left empty on purpose: the registry's CONTRIBUTING §2b
    says `[]` states something absence does not — code reads this and no Index cell comes out of it
    — and six vendored entries say exactly that. Filed-under and feeds are different questions and
    this is the second one; `bali-air-dispatch` is filed Environmental|Community and feeds
    Environmental|City.

    **What counts at all.** Only two statuses count anywhere. `deprecated`, `stale`, `paywalled` and
    `planned` count nowhere, because a number that includes a source no node can call is the kind of
    number the Index was criticised for. Sixteen of today's 225 entries are in that group.

        capable    status `live` AND an `adapter` — code here reads it
        reviewed   status `live` AND (an `adapter` OR a review whose verdict is in USABLE).
                   That OR is not a shortcut: it mirrors the registry's own join rule exactly
                   (scripts/validate.py, "N live entries carry neither a review nor an adapter"),
                   so this node and the list it carries agree on what backs the word `live`.
        candidate  status `candidate` — verified, and nobody has read it for a real territory

    capable is therefore a subset of reviewed. A cell whose entries are all deprecated still gets a
    key, with three zeros: "registered and nothing usable" is an answer, and a missing key is not."""
