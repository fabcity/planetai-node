"""Where an alert goes: Telegram, the LoRa mesh and the Reticulum bridge (LXMF).

Moved out of app/main.py unchanged (22 Oct 2026). `notify()` is the one call a rule, the report or a route makes; the
mesh and Reticulum get act-level alerts only, Telegram gets everything. `mesh_state` is written by the MQTT thread in
main, the same dict, because a downlink needs the root topic an uplink taught it. Home Assistant is a pack since 22 Oct
2026 (packs/home-assistant): it hears every alert and every stored reading through packs.emit.
