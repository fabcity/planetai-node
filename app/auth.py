# What a request carrying no token may read at each SHARE_LEVEL: exact paths, plus the prefixes for the two routes that
# carry a wildcard. Anything not named here is refused — /place/geojson, /settings/raw, /backups, /aggregates and every
# write — so a route added next release is private until someone puts it on this list on purpose. That is the opposite
# of the SELECT * in /sensors, which published every new column the day it landed (A7).
#
# The `off` list is the dashboard's shell and the two reads that keep the node's own machinery running: /export, which
# backup.sh fetches over the published port to write the daily CC-BY file (already rounded to 3 dp and public by
# design), and /settings, reduced to UI_LAYOUT and SHARE_LEVEL by the route itself.
#
# The `open` list is what a wall screen on the house WiFi needs: the twenty-one paths the dashboard fetches
# (`grep -oE "(api|fetch)\('/[a-z0-9/._{}-]+" app/static/index.html`), less the three writes and /place/geojson, plus
# the two <img> routes that grep does not see (/earth/year.png at index.html:904, /earth/change.png from /earth's
# png_url) and the other-consumer reads /readings, /exports and /export.
# /sources is on the `open` list and named on purpose rather than left to default-private: it is a
# byte-identical copy of a public registry of public datasets, the same 209 rows on every node in a
# release. It says nothing about this house — not a sensor, not a reading, not a coordinate. /packs,
# already here, describes this node's own configuration and is more revealing than it is.
# /presence is here and not on the `open` list because the RETICULUM BRIDGE reads it, and the bridge
# is another container with no token: on the default SHARE_LEVEL=off it would be refused and presence
# would silently never announce. It is safe at every level by construction — it answers `{"enabled":
# false}` until a household turns announcing on, and after that it returns the same handful of facts
# the node is already broadcasting to every radio in reach.
# /nodes is here because it is the programme's public registry.json, the same on every node: it says which nodes
# exist and nothing about this house.
# /ground/* is on `open` because every layer under it is a public dataset (OpenStreetMap, OpenAerialMap, Sentinel-2,
# Open-Meteo) cut around the node, and its centre is no closer than the point /health already rounds. /geo/cell is
# there too, but the route drops what it says relative to the node (is_node, cells_from_node, *_polar) for a
# caller without a token: asked at res 15 cell by cell, those would find the house. The phone's walk needs both
# (Tomas, 12 Oct 2026: one phone mode, no token, for the person running the node).
