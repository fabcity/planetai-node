"""What the node knows about the window it is about to report on, and the report it writes from that on its own.

Two things live here, in this order, because the second is the ruler for everything that comes after it:

  bundle(cur, hours)      every number the node has about the last `hours`, as one JSON-able document
  sheet(bundle, locale)   the node's own report, deterministic, four parts, under a hundred words

The sheet is what a household gets on a node with no model anywhere, which is most nodes. When a model is in the
path it is handed the bundle and the sheet, and anything it writes is checked against the numbers in them before
it is allowed out. So the bundle is the only place a number may come from, and the sheet is what the node falls
back to. Neither may need the network: it is all SQL against this node's own tables.
