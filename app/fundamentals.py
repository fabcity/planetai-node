"""The sources every node needs for its basic job, and how to tell each one is running.

One list, here. GET /health/sources reads it; `planetai doctor`, install.sh and update.sh (through the doctor), the
Set up page and an agent read that route — so the fix a household is given is written once, in this file.

The order is the order of "To finish setting up": most important first. A node with no sensor of its own measures
nothing here; a node nobody hears from is a log file; the rest are what it compares against and how it keeps its past.

States, one per source:
  ok        a reading inside its window (`fresh_minutes`), or a backup that young
  missing   not set up. `fix` says how.
  quiet     set up, and nothing inside its window. `fix_quiet` says what to look at.
  waiting   set up, nothing yet, and the node has not finished a poll since it started: after an install or an update
            the first reading is minutes away, and calling that a fault would put a cross on every new node.
  na        does not apply here (public stations outside Bali: no network this node can read there yet)
  elsewhere the backups are kept outside this container (BACKUP_DIR); the doctor on the machine judges them
The map is fetched once, not read: ok with the day it was fetched, or missing.
`ok` is true, false or null (waiting, na, elsewhere): only false asks somebody to do something.
