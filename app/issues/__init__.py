"""Issues — what a place can be better or worse at, that a household recognises by name.

The core measures nothing in particular (docs/DOMAINS.md, first line). The dashboard was the one
component that did: it knew the word `pm25`, it knew WHO 15, and it worked out for itself which
sensor was "the room". This package is where that knowledge moves, so the page can go back to
drawing.

One `.yml` per issue, in this directory. Each declares its name in three languages, whether it is
sensed or context, its metric and unit, its line, which packs feed it, how each of the four
distances is computed, its sentence templates, and what to say with no source. **Adding a fifth
issue is a fifth `.yml` plus a pack that declares its domain, and nothing else changes** —
`tests/test_issues.py` asserts exactly that by loading a synthetic `water.yml`.

Loading is as dumb as `app/packs.py`: read the directory, parse the YAML, validate, log and skip
anything broken. A malformed file must not take the node down; `make lint` is where a broken file in
this repo gets caught.

# CHANGED 23 September 2026 (R25), following the programme page. The page names the four distances
# house · street · ring · region, and Tomas decided the node and the documentation say the same, so
# a reader moving between the programme page, the docs and this dashboard meets one vocabulary. The
# rule from 21 September holds: a heading and the sentence under it name the same thing, in every
# language, which is why WHERE_WORDS and NOUN_WORDS moved with this table. Indonesian and Spanish
# translate the English words rather than borrowing them; both want a native reader's pass.
#
# The API KEYS do not change. `room/yard/ring/region` are what `/issues.distances` publishes, what
# every issue's `stack` is keyed on and what a pack's `where:` block overrides; renaming those would
# be a wire break for a wording problem. Only the words a person reads change.
