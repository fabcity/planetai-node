"""`GET /issues` and `GET /issues/fixtures/{name}`.

Two routes on one prefix, which is the point: `/issues` goes on the `SHARE_LEVEL=open` allowlist and
never on the `off` one, and that single entry covers both. A snapshot carries 15-minute means, alert
texts and sensor names — the household's own data — so a fixture must not be served from `/static/`,
which is readable at `off`.

`app/main.py` learns about this file in exactly two lines: `include_router` and the `/issues` prefix
in `_SHARE_OPEN`. Everything else about issues lives in this package.
