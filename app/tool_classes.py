"""What each MCP tool is allowed to be, and the notes that are not notes.

Its own module, importing NOTHING, because two processes need it: `app/agent.py`, which registers the
tools, and `app/agent_loop.py`, which hands a subset of them to the local model. Importing `agent.py`
from the loop would drag the whole MCP server into a process that does not serve MCP, and would make
every test that stubs `mcp` stub more of it.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------- what each tool is allowed to be
#
# NO TOOL IS REMOVED BY THIS TABLE. A remote agent operated by a person — a keeper in Claude Desktop over
# the tailnet — may still need `settings_set`, and taking it away would make the node worse for the case
# the MCP surface was built for. The table exists so that the LOCAL model's loop can be given a subset
# (app/agent_loop.py::LOCAL_TOOLS) and so that `planetai agent` can print what each one is.
#
#   read   asks the node a question. Nothing changes.
#   act    records that a HUMAN did something. The one write a model may make, and only with the
#          human's own words — see act() below.
#   admin  changes the node, runs code on it, or makes it speak to the household unprompted.
#
# `report_now` is admin and the review's list of three did not have it. It writes a report AND SENDS IT:
# a model calling it is the node interrupting a household because a model felt like it. That is an
# admin act however small the diff.
#
# `settings_get` is read: it hands over chat ids and sensor hostnames but changes nothing, and the local
# model is already on the machine those facts describe.
