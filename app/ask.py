"""The dashboard's ask pane: `GET /ask/status`, `POST /ask`, `GET /docs/search`.

A person reading the page asks the node's own model, on this machine, about what the page shows. The loop is
`agent_loop.pane`: it reads, and anything else it reaches for comes back as a proposal the person presses.

THREE PROMISES, EACH HELD BY A TEST IN tests/test_ask.py:

  · The context carries no coordinate, no room or sensor name, no sensor id and no `meta`. It is built here from
    the /issues bundle the page already has, and every tool result passes through the same `scrub` before the
    model reads it. A local model is on the machine those facts describe; the rule holds anyway, because a pane
    open on a wall is read by whoever walks past, and what the model is never told it cannot repeat.
  · Nothing is stored. No transcript on disk, no row, no log line with a word anybody typed. The thread lives in
    the browser tab and dies with it.
  · Nothing is changed. An `act` or an admin tool is a `proposal` event; the page presses it with its own token.

`/docs/search` needs no model: a case-insensitive substring over learn.json and data/docs_site.json, which
`make learn` cuts out of docs/site at build time, because the container never sees docs/.
