"""Sources. Each adapter is a function that returns (sensors, readings).

    sensors : list of dicts  {sensor_id, source, name, lat, lon, indoor, local, meta,
                              kind:  sensor | portal | model | survey   (how the number was produced)

              kind and scale default to sensor/community — set them on anything that isn't a device at the address.
    readings: list of tuples (ts: datetime UTC, sensor_id, metric, value)

That's the whole contract. Add a source = add a function here + register it in SOURCES.
Core ships the global models and open portals. A vendor's device comes as a pack, on the LAN (packs/airgradient,
packs/purpleair) or through its cloud (packs/smartcitizen), and so does a network of public stations
(packs/bali-air-dispatch).
See docs/sensors.md to add another.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------- Meshtastic (LoRa mesh, via the gateway's MQTT uplink)
# The gateway radio (an ESP32 with WiFi) uplinks the mesh to the node's Mosquitto. With "JSON output" enabled on the
# gateway, each packet arrives on   msh/<REGION>/2/json/<channel>/!<gateway>   as a JSON object with "type" and
# "payload". This is a pure function: one MQTT message in, sensors and readings out, so it is tested offline.
#   telemetry  -> readings (environment_metrics / air_quality_metrics / power fields flattened into payload)
#   position   -> the sensor's lat/lon (Tracker L1 boards carry GPS)
#   nodeinfo   -> the sensor's name
# Metric names follow the rest of the node; field names follow Meshtastic firmware 2.7.26, both as its own MQTT JSON
# writes them (MeshPacketSerializer.cpp) and as the host gateway snake-cases the protobuf. Keys are matched with their
# underscores taken out, because MessageToDict says rainfall1h where the firmware says rainfall_1h. If a future
# firmware renames a field the adapter logs the unknown key once rather than silently dropping it.
# Not filed, on purpose: an MLX90632 on a radio sends a surface's temperature as environment `temperature`, and the
# packet cannot say so; it would read as `temp`, which is already an enclosure reading never averaged as the street's
# (config/channels.yml). Do not fit an MLX90632 to a radio whose temperature matters. An MLX90614 sends its die
# temperature there and the object's in health_metrics, which the gateway does not uplink.
