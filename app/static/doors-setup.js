/* SET UP — a page of its own (R43, 7 Oct 2026), opened by the gear in the bar. How this node was told to behave.

   Design (refero-design, reference-locked): mono.frm.fm's architectural grid owns the canvas — 1px ink rules, square
   corners, outlined controls, tracked mono labels, colour only where the node's rules give it a meaning; Linear's
   preferences own the structure — a sticky list of sections on the left, rows of label and help with the control on
   the right; Arcade's privacy settings own the share level — two options, each saying what a screen without the
   token gets; Enode's developer settings own the save — explicit, saying what it will change, with what crosses the
   house's edge set apart. The one move to remember: every setting that changes what leaves this machine says so,
   and the save bar counts them before anything is written.

   Behaviour is the dashboard's Set up pane (dashboard.js, "the Set up pane"), carried over rule for rule because
   each rule was learned on node #1: a save sends only what changed; a key that moved on the node while this page
   was open is not overwritten until the keeper has seen it; the node's own refusal is printed beside its field; a
   key with choices offers only them; a secret is write-only; the pack switches write PACKS_ENABLED; what is read at
   start is shown and never sent. ponytail: the group words are copied from dashboard.js (GROUPS) because four suites
   read that pane out of that file by name; one copy when / becomes the doors. */
