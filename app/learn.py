"""What worked here (docs/SPEC_learn.md step 1): the household's own evidence, from the actions ledger.

For every act-level alert on one sensor that somebody acted on, or that nobody answered at all, the node takes the
metric the rule watches on that sensor in the hour before (the act, or the alert when unanswered) and its mean over a
window after, and the same two numbers on the street (every outdoor sensor). Per rule it keeps the medians as one row
of `learnings`, with its cases, so the page can show the proof.

WHAT IT DOES NOT CLAIM, AND THE ROW SAYS SO: a cause. GET /effect already warns that air clearing at 03:00 may be the
window or the night. Here the street's change is beside the house's, and the unanswered alerts beside the acted ones,
which is more than a before and after; it is still not an experiment.

Hourly, because readings_1h is what a node keeps for every sensor; the hour before the act ends up to 59 minutes
before it. Code proves, a model only words (SPEC_learn §2): the statement is a template over the numbers.
