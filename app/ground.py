"""The dashboard hero's ground: this node's own H3 cell, drawn from NODE_LAT / NODE_LON.

Until v0.37 every node shipped the same file, `static/node-ground.svg`, which is node #1's cell in
Kuta Selatan. On a Barcelona node it was geometry that looked like the node's own cell and was not,
so the caption naming the cell was stripped and the drawing claimed nothing. This draws the real
one, and the caption goes back because it is now true wherever the node stands.

The drawing is planetai-design's `planetai-geo/index.mjs` nodeGround(), in Python, because the node
has no Node.js and a household LAN may have no route out: the ground has to be computable here.
Same geometry, same projection, same numbers — `tests/test_ground.py` holds the two together by
redrawing node #1's cell and comparing it to the design kit's own output, vertex for vertex.

Projection: Lambert azimuthal equal-area centred on the node, which is d3.geoAzimuthalEqualArea()
.rotate([-lon, -lat]) and is on the design kit's allow-list for this drawing with its reason
recorded (design-log, 7 Sep): the cell is about half a kilometre across, and Equal Earth squashes
east-west by 25% at node #1's latitude. Every vertex is projected and written straight into the
path. d3's adaptive resampling is float noise at this scale and drops vertices from small polygons
without erroring; there is nothing to resample in a hexagon anyway.
