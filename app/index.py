    zero as a household that never checks its work. What the node does have is the rule itself: run_rules re-fires an alert as soon as its cooldown
    expires and the condition still holds. So an act followed by MEASURED_WINDOW_MIN of silence from the same rule on
    the same sensor is the condition having stopped being true, on every node, retroactively, with nobody asked to
    learn a new habit. A posted measured row still counts if one ever arrives.

    This is evidence of WHETHER, not of WHEN — see latency_minutes below.

    its own (docs/SPEC_rho.md) and its `acted` means "acknowledged OR acted, within 24 hours" — a
    deliberately generous test of whether anybody answered at all. The funnel's `acted` is the
    literal stage. The two will not agree and are not meant to; they are different questions asked
    of the same ledger, which is why this is a separate query returning separate names.

    that rho is defined on. It does not push stages — `events` carries `responded_at` and `acted_at`
    and no notion of `measured` — so a pooled funnel would report every child's ask as never reaching
    a stage the child cannot express. One node's ledger, honestly, beats a district's with a hole.
