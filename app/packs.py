"""Packs — the extension point. Core packs ship in packs/ with the release; wild packs are added by whoever runs
the node (`planetai packs add`, docs/decisions/2026-10-01-packs.md).

A pack is a folder in packs/ with a pack.yaml and any of:
    rules.yml    extra alert rules (SQL + message)      DATA — no code, safe to merge from anyone
    cells.yml    extra Index cells (SQL → fci-cells-v0) DATA — no code
    adapter.py   a source adapter (Python function)     CODE — runs with the node's privileges
    hooks.py     on_readings / on_alert, called by emit()  CODE — the same

Data packs are the default and the point: most useful contributions are a rule and a threshold that
someone learned the hard way in their city. Code packs need review — see docs/PACKS.md.

Loading is deliberately dumb: scan the directory, parse the YAML, import the module. No registry service,
no dependency resolution, no lifecycle hooks. If a pack is broken the node logs it and carries on.
