"""The alert events as GET /issues carries them (docs/SPEC_dashboard_events.md §3.1).

`build` is pure, so a live node (datetimes) and a capture (ISO strings) go through the same code and are tested apart.
`live` (Task 3) is the reads, on the cursor the /issues route already has open. The page computes nothing from this
