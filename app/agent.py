"""The node as a set of tools for an AI agent, over MCP.

Mounted on the API at /mcp (streamable HTTP). A remote Claude reaches it over Tailscale; a local model on the same
machine reaches it on localhost. Reads are what the API already gives; writes need the admin token and record which
agent did them (the X-Agent header, default "agent").

What an agent can do here: read the node, act on an alert, change runtime settings, enable packs, run a pack's
scripts, get one day as open data. What it cannot do from here: anything that needs Docker or git on the host
(update, backup, restart). For those, `maintenance` returns the exact command to run on the node; an agent with a
shell runs it, an agent without one tells the person.
