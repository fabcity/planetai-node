"""Hold the vendored source registry to its pin, and every pack's `sources:` id to an entry in it.

    python3 tools/check_registry.py          # in `make lint`

`data/sources/` is a snapshot of `awesome-fabcity-data` at one commit (tools/sync_registry.sh). Seven
things have to stay true about it, and one is only a warning.

  · REGISTRY_VERSION is there and parses — without it nothing downstream can say what it is serving.
  · Its `entries` count, the YAML file count and index.json's length are the same number. They come
    apart when a sync is interrupted, and the symptom is a node quietly serving a short list.
  · index.json is exactly what the YAML folds to. Nothing here edits a source entry: the registry's
    source of truth is upstream, and a hand edit that survives is a fork nobody declared.
  · Every entry sits in the directory its own `pillar`/`scale` name, because `slug` and `cell` are
    both derived from the path and a mismatch makes them lie.
  · Every `sources:` id in every packs/*/pack.yaml resolves to an entry.
  · Every review under reviews/ names an `entry` that is one of the vendored entries. A review of a
    source this pin does not carry is evidence about nothing, and it would fold onto no row.
  · Every cells/<file>.yaml is named for its own `cell` key. Both are no-ops on a pin taken before
    those trees existed upstream, which is every pin before 2026-09-22.

**This replaced tools/check_sources.py, which asked the last question of a sibling checkout of the
registry — and so answered it only on a laptop that had one.** In CI and on a node it printed a line
and exited 0, which meant a pack could name a slug that does not exist and the build stayed green all
the way to a tarball. It also let a pack name a slug that is on upstream main but not in the pin,
which 404s on every node that installs it. The snapshot is here, so now the check is too.

`synced` older than 180 days WARNS and does not fail — the convention data/platform_floors.yml set.
A stale pin is a conversation about a sync, not a broken build.
