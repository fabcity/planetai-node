"""The dashboard, browsable, from a committed fixture and no database.

    python3 tools/preview.py [fixture] [--port 8123]
    open http://127.0.0.1:8123/?fixture=<name>

WHY THIS EXISTS. Reviewing the page meant one of two things: static renders from
`tests/visual/measure.mjs`, which nobody can click, or a whole node with Postgres and Docker behind
it. This is the third: a real browser on the real page, with a real capture of a real node, and
nothing to install. Every number on it is node #1's.

IT SERVES WHAT THE NODE SERVES AND NOT ONE PATH MORE. `COMPANIONS` is imported from `app/main.py`
rather than reimplemented, and `/static/<name>` takes a NAME — no slashes, no traversal, no falling
through to the directory layout. The measuring rig once fell through to the layout, served
`/static/fonts/x.woff2`, and so hid for weeks that the mono had never loaded on a node. A preview
that is more generous than the thing it previews reports a page that does not exist.

The routes are the snapshot's own keys under the paths the node answers them at, which is what
`serveNodeAPI()` in the rig does for the same reason. `/issues` is REPLAYED through the engine rather
than served from the file, so what you read is what this checkout's code makes of that data — which
is the point of previewing a branch.
