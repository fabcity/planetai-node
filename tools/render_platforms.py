"""Render the floors table in docs/PLATFORMS.md from data/platform_floors.yml.

The page used to carry the numbers as prose, so the prose and the code could disagree — and did: the page
said "macOS 13+, install OrbStack" when OrbStack needs 14. Now one file holds the floors, this writes the
table, and `make lint` fails when the page has drifted from the data.

  python3 tools/render_platforms.py          rewrite the block
