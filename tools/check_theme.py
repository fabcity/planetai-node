"""Hold the node's copy of the frozen layer to the design repo it was copied from.

    python3 tools/check_theme.py                 # in `make lint`, and it FAILS
    python3 tools/check_theme.py --update        # after copying new files from planetai-design

Three files under `app/static/` are not this repo's to edit: `planetai-theme.css` is generated from
planetai-design/references/planetai-layer.md, and `signs.svg` and `kilometre-cells.json` are that
repo's assets. They were copied here because a node serves its dashboard on a LAN that may have no
route out, and a copy with no guard drifts — a colour edited on this side reaches every screen in
the house on the next reload with nothing having said what moved. This is the guard.

**It used to read a sibling checkout, and so answered nowhere that mattered.** This runs where
`make lint` runs — a dev machine and CI — and `planetai-design` is checked out on neither by default.
There it printed one line and exited 0, so an edit to a frozen file passed **every automated check a
pull request gets**, and the tarball carried it to every node on the next update. The same hole
`tools/check_sources.py` had, found the same way (19 Sep 2026). So the question is now asked of
something that is always here: `data/frozen_layer.txt` records the sha256 of each file and the
planetai-design commit they were copied from, and the hashes are checked on every lint, everywhere.

That is not a weaker guard than the byte comparison, because it does not replace it. Where the design
repo IS checked out, both run — and the comparison now reads the **pinned commit** rather than
whatever branch that checkout is sitting on. It was sitting on `dashboard-directions-2026-09` the day
this was written, and a gate whose answer depends on a neighbour's branch is not a gate.

`--update` rewrites the pin, and REFUSES to do it unless the design repo is present and the files
match it. You cannot bless a local edit by re-running it; you can only record a copy that was really
made. That is the whole reason the two halves are kept.

**One line is allowed to differ, and it is named.** `planetai-theme.css` declares the mono at
`fonts/jetbrains-mono-latin.woff2`. `GET /static/{name}` takes a NAME and not a path, deliberately,
on a port that answers a household LAN, so that request 404s — a cost of one request, paid on
purpose, because the alternative is a path parameter reaching the filesystem. `tokens.css` — this
repo's file, where the other three faces already live — declares the same family at the flat name
the node does serve, which is the declaration that resolves. This said `dashboard.css` until
21 September 2026, and NO file declared it at all: the mono was the fourth of four faces and the
only one never brought over, so every number on the page had been in a fallback since the layer
arrived. So a `src:` line whose two sides name the same FILE by different paths is reported and
forgiven. Anything else — a second such line, a different file, a changed token, a moved brace —
fails, and the fix is to copy the file again rather than to widen this.

Point the design repo somewhere else with PLANETAI_DESIGN_REPO.
