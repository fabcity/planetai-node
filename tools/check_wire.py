"""The five wire formats' top-level keys are a committed file, and changing one is a deliberate act.

ARCHITECTURE.md §3 names the contracts that must not change casually. "Casually" is the operative
word: nothing stopped a key being added to `/export` — pinned to IPFS forever — or dropped from
`GET /issues` in a commit about something else. Now `tests/data/wire/<format>.json` holds the top-level
key list of each document, and this fails when the source and the fixture disagree. Updating a wire
format means editing two files in the same commit, one of which is a reviewer's eye.

It does NOT check values, types, or anything nested. Those change every hour; the top level is the
contract, and a contract that tried to pin the readings would be updated by a cron and assert nothing.

Read statically, with `ast`, for two reasons: `make lint` runs on a node with no database and in CI
with no Postgres, and a regex over a dict literal that spans forty lines and nests four deep is the
flimsier algorithm for the same effort.

`**expr` at the top level of a wire document is REFUSED rather than resolved. A splat is how a key
gets into a document without appearing in it, which is precisely what this gate exists to stop.
