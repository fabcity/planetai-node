"""Build app/static/learn.json, the learn layer's marks, out of docs/site.

    python3 tools/build_learn.py            # write app/static/learn.json
    python3 tools/build_learn.py --check    # fail if the committed file is not what docs/site says

The node does not serve docs/site; the site build does. So the marks are extracted here, at build
time, into one small file the page fetches only in learn mode. Every quote is a VERBATIM span of the
page it cites — this tool never writes a word of its own into `quote`, it only cuts. A docs edit that
moves the prose therefore changes learn.json, `--check` fails in `make lint`, and somebody has to look
at the diff. That is the whole point: the tester guide cannot drift from the documentation it claims
to be quoting, because it is not a copy of it, it is a cut of it.

MARKS below names the cut, not the text: page, the `##` section it must sit inside, and the first and
last few words of the span. Short markers survive a reflow; a pasted paragraph does not. Each entry
also carries the page's own `# Title` as `page_title`, so the card can cite "From <title> · <section>"
the way the site names it, rather than by a path in this repository.

The marks explain what the node is FOR and what it PUBLISHES as well as how to read the ladder: the
purpose and the DIDO rule from introduction.md sit on the foot and on the request ledger, and every
registered section carries at least one mark (tests/test_learn.py holds the page to that).

`more` is the only prose here, and it is the PAGE talking about itself — what this dashboard draws,
in the dashboard's voice — never a paraphrase of the docs. The card labels it as such.

`questions` is two short questions per mark in each locale, the ask pane's chips while that mark's card
is in focus. They are the page asking, never the documentation answering.
