"""Hold the programme page to the node it describes.

    python3 tools/check_site.py                  # against ../planetai (or PLANETAI_SITE_REPO)
    python3 tools/check_site.py --version v0.73  # and the release about to be cut (tools/release.sh)

The programme page (planetai.fab.city, `web/src/data.js` in the site repo) states facts about this
repository: the release, how many packs, which languages, how many documentation pages, node #1's ρ.
On 23 September 2026 it was eight releases behind while every gate in both repos was green, because
no gate compared the two (R25). This is that gate. `tools/release.sh` runs it before tagging, so a
release cannot be cut while the page describes another one.

It also holds the purpose to one wording. `docs/site/introduction.md` is the canonical statement; the
programme page, the README, `llms.txt`, `AGENTS.md`, the dashboard's foot and the node's own /llms.txt
quote it, and a copy that drifts fails here rather than on a reader.

It reads the site's source with regular expressions, not a JavaScript engine: `data.js` is a file of
literals, and a fact this cannot find is reported as missing rather than guessed. A site repo that is
not checked out beside this one is skipped with a warning, because a node's CI has no site repo.
